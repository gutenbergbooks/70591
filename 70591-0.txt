PREFACE.


From my early youth I heartily desired to know more of the life of my
great-great-aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu. Every scrap of information I
could pick up respecting her I accumulated; therefore when my cousins,
Mrs. Wellesley and her sister, Miss Montagu, in October, 1899, gave me
the whole of her manuscripts contained in 68 cases, holding from 100 to
150 letters in each, my joy was unbounded!

In 1810 my grandfather, the 4th Baron Rokeby (her nephew and adopted
son), published two volumes of her letters; these were followed by
two more volumes in 1813. To enable him to perform this pleasing
task he asked all her principal friends to return her letters to
him, beginning with the Dowager Marchioness of Bath,[1] daughter of
the Duchess of Portland, who gave him back the earliest letters to
her mother, many carefully inserted in a curious grey paper book by
the duchess, who placed the date of reception on each, and evidently
valued them exceedingly. The Rev. Montagu Pennington returned her
letters to his aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, the learned translator of
Epictetus; Mrs. Freind those to her husband; and many other people
did the same. From General Pulteney, at Lord Bath’s death, she had
asked for and received her correspondence with Lord Bath, which she
carefully preserved. At the death of Lord Lyttelton, the executors,
at her request, returned her her letters; those to Gilbert West and
other correspondents were returned in the same manner. Meanwhile she
kept all letters of her special friends, as well as notabilities,
so that one may deem the collection quite unique, though doubtless
many letters have disappeared, notably those of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
many of whose letters were destroyed by an ignorant caretaker of Mrs.
Montagu’s house, Denton Hall, near Newcastle-on-Tyne. There are none of
Horace Walpole’s, from whom she must have received some; and those from
several other celebrities she knew well are missing.

    [1] _Née_ Elizabeth Cavendish, born 1735, died 1825, ætat 91.

Owing to the enormous quantity of letters undated, the sorting has
been terribly difficult, and I spent one entire winter in making up
bundles and labelling each year. My grandfather made a variety of
mistakes as to the dates of the letters. I hope I have atoned for some
of his deficiencies, though a few mistakes are probably inevitable. He
nearly blinded himself by working at night, and my grandmother[2] had
constantly to copy the letters in a large round hand to enable him to
make them out. After my grandmother’s death he discontinued arranging
them, though they might have been continued till 1800, the year of Mrs.
Montagu’s death.

    [2] _Née_ Elizabeth Charlton.

In the present volumes only her early life is presented, interwoven
with portions of her most intimate friends’ letters to herself. Were
the whole of this vast correspondence printed, a large bookcase could
be filled with the volumes. In order to consult the varied tastes of
the general reader, I have endeavoured to pick out the most interesting
portions of her letters, such as relate to customs, fashions in dress,
price of food, habits, but I have often groaned in spirit at having
to leave out much that was noble in sentiment, or long comments upon
contemporary books and events. If life should be spared me, I hope
to be able to continue my narrative, for, like the ring produced by
a stone thrown on the water, her circle of friends and acquaintances
increased yearly, and not only comprised her English friends and every
person of distinction in Great Britain, but also the most distinguished
foreigners of all nations, notably the French. It has been asserted
that Gilbert West was the first person to influence Mrs. Montagu on
religious points. That his amiable Christianity may have strengthened
her religious opinions I do not deny, but I hope it will be seen from
this book that from her earliest days, when at the height of her _joie
de vivre_, the religious sentiment was existent--a religion that
prompted her ever to the kindest actions to all classes, that had
nothing bitter or narrow in it, no dogmatism. Adored by men of all
opinions, and liking their society, she was the purest of the pure,
as is amply proved by the letters of Lord Lyttelton, Dr. Monsey, and
others, but she was no prude with all this. Her worthy husband adored
her, and no wife could have been more devoted and obedient than she
was. His was a noble character, and doubtless influenced her much for
good. As a wife, a friend, a _camarade_ in all things, grave or gay,
she was unequalled; as a housewife she was notable, beloved by her
servants, by the poor of her parish, and by her miners and their wives
and children. She planned feasts and dances and instituted schools for
them, and fed and clothed the destitute.

With Mr. Raikes[3] she was one of the first people to institute
Sunday-schools. She was as interested in Betty’s rheumatism as she
was in the conversation of a duke or a duchess; a discussion with
bishops and Gilbert West on religion, or with Emerson on mathematics,
or Elizabeth Carter on Epictetus, all came alike to her gifted nature.
She danced with the gay, she wept with the mourner; her sympathies
never lay idle, even to the very end of life; and in a century which
has been deemed by many to be coarse, uneducated, and irreligious,
her sweet wholesome nature shone like a star, and attracted all minor
lights. Where in the twentieth century should we find a coterie of
men and women of the highest rank and influence in the world, either
from intellect or position, so content and devoted to each other, so
free from the petty jealousies and sarcasms of the present fashionable
society, so anxious for each other’s welfare, socially and morally; so
free from cant or prudery, so devoted to each other’s interest?

    [3] Robert Raikes, born 1735, died 1811. The first Sunday-school
    instituted by him in 1781.

A great and terrible break in this book was caused by the death of my
beloved husband in May, 1904, after a long, lingering illness. I doubt
if I should have taken courage to resume my pen if it had not been for
my friend Mr. A. M. Broadley, whose interest in my literary work and
affectionate solicitude for myself has been a kindly spur to goad me
on to action, so as to complete the present volumes. To him I tender
my thanks for past and present encouragement, as well as many other
kindnesses.

ELIZABETH MONTAGU

THE QUEEN OF THE BLUE-STOCKINGS




CHAPTER I.

GIRLHOOD UP TO 1738, AND BEGINNING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE
DUCHESS OF PORTLAND.


[Page heading: THE ROBINSON FAMILY]

Before entering on the life of Elizabeth Robinson, afterwards Mrs.
Edward Montagu, the famous _bas bleu_, the focus, as she may be called,
of all the cleverest and most intellectual society of the last half
of the eighteenth century, a few words must be said of the family she
sprang from. The Robinsons are said to have been originally Robertsons,
the name being corrupted into Robinson. They are in many Peerages[4]
said to descend from the Robertsons of Struan, or Strowan, in
Perthshire, who descended from Duncan de Atholia, Earl of Athole, hence
descendants of Duncan, King of Scotland. My grandfather, the 4th Baron
Rokeby, in an unfinished pedigree, believed this, but there have been
Robinsons bearing the same[5] coat-of-arms in Yorkshire as early as the
time of copyhold record in Edward III.’s reign. However, they may have
been related. Our narrative starts from William, said to be younger
son of the 7th Baron Robertson of Strowan, who, being deprived of his
portion of inheritance as younger son by the Earl of Athole, fled into
England, and settled at Kendal in Westmorland, in the time of Henry
VIII. He had three children, Ralph, Henry, and Ursula. Ralph married
Agnes Philip, by whom he had William, who succeeded to his father’s
estates at Kendal and Brignal, and who on June 7, 1610, bought the
estate of Rokeby in Yorkshire from Sir Thomas Rokeby, whose family had
been possessed of it before the Conquest. Rokeby continued to belong to
the Robinson family for 160 years, when “Long Sir Thomas Robinson” sold
it in 1769 to John B. Saurey Morritt, the friend of Sir Walter Scott.
The Robinsons finally assumed two lines (_vide_ Pedigree), William,
the eldest, remaining master of Rokeby, and his posthumous brother,
Leonard, becoming the direct ancestor of our heroine. Leonard Robinson
was a merchant in London; he became Chamberlain of the City of London,
and was knighted on October 26, 1692. He married, first, Lucy Layton,
of West Layton, etc., by whom he had no issue. For his second wife
he married Deborah, daughter of Sir James Collet, Knight and Sheriff
of London, by whom he had six daughters, all of whom married and had
issue, and one son, Thomas, who married a widow, Elizabeth Light. She
was daughter of William Clarke, Esq., of Merivale Abbey, Warwickshire,
and heiress of her brother, William Clarke. By her first husband,
Anthony Light, she had one daughter, Lydia. By her second marriage with
Thomas Robinson she had three sons. Matthew, the eldest, alone concerns
us as father of Mrs. Montagu. The following table will show the
connection between the Robinson and Sterne families: the Rev. Laurence
Sterne marrying their cousin, Elizabeth Lumley:--

    age of thirty-three, in the year 1700.

[Year: 1694]

[Page heading: THE MORRIS FAMILY]

We now enter on the history of Matthew Robinson, the eldest surviving
son of Thomas, and his wife Elizabeth. He was born in 1694, therefore
was only six years old when his father died. At an early age he was
entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became a fellow-commoner.
He was a person of great intellectual parts, a conversationalist and
wit, the life of the coffee-houses, which then served, as clubs do
nowadays, as a rendezvous for men of fashion. His talent for painting
was remarkable. His great nephew states, “He acquired so great a
proficiency as to excel most of the professional artists of his day
in landscape.” At the early age of eighteen, in 1712, he married
Elizabeth Drake, daughter of Councillor Robert Drake, of Cambridge,
descended from the Drakes of Ashe in Devonshire. Elizabeth’s mother’s
name was Sarah Morris. The Morris family had been seated in Kent at
East Horton since the reign of Elizabeth. Thomas Morris, father of
Sarah, built the mansion of Mount Morris, sometimes called Monk’s
Horton, near Hythe. He had one son, Thomas, who was drowned under
London Bridge on his return from Holland in 1697, ætat 23. His sister
Sarah had two children by Councillor Drake, Morris and Elizabeth. Their
maternal grandfather lived to 1717, when he devised his estates to his
grandson, Morris Drake, with the proviso of his assuming the extra
name of Morris, and failing of his issue with remainder to Elizabeth,
his sister, then Mrs. Matthew Robinson. Her mother, Mrs. Drake, having

[Year: 1712]

[Page heading: ELIZABETH ROBINSON]

To return to the Robinsons, they settled at their property of West
Layton Hall, derived from Lucy Layton, first wife of Sir Leonard
Robinson, and Edgeley in Wensleydale for the summer, and spent the
winter in York; most country families at that period repairing to
London or their nearest county town for convenience and society during
the winter. To this young couple were born twelve children, of whom
seven sons and two daughters lived to grow up--

1. Matthew, born April 6, 1713; afterwards 2nd Baron Rokeby. Educated
at Trinity Hall, Cambridge; became a Fellow. Died November 30, 1800,
ætat 87.

2. Thomas, born 1714, died in 1746–7. Barrister-at-law.

3. Morris, born 1715, died 1777; of the Six Clerks’ Office.

4. _Elizabeth, born at York, October 2, 1720, died August 25, 1800._

5. Robert, Captain, E.I.C.S. Died in China, 1756.

8. John, of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

9. Charles, born 1733, died 1807.

[Page heading: DR. CONYERS MIDDLETON]

Elizabeth, the subject of this book, was about seven years old when,
by the death of her uncle, Morris Drake Morris, her mother inherited,
as his heir, the important property of East Horton, and Mount Morris
in Kent. The family then left Yorkshire for residence at Mount Morris.
But before and after their inheritance of the Kentish property
much time was spent with the Conyers Middletons both at Coveney,
Cambridgeshire, a property Mrs. Conyers Middleton had inherited from
her first husband, Councillor Drake; the advowson of the living being
hers, she bestowed it on her second husband, Dr. Conyers Middleton,[7]
whom she had married in 1710; also at Cambridge, where was their usual
residence, and where several of the little Robinsons were born in their
grandmother’s house, as we learn from a letter of Dr. Middleton’s.
Elizabeth Robinson was naturally much with her grandmother, with whom
and Conyers Middleton she was a great favourite. Her nephew and adopted
son, in his volumes of her letters[8] that he published in 1810,
states--

 “Her uncommon sensibility and acuteness of understanding, as well
 as extraordinary beauty as a child, rendered her an object of
 great notice in the University, and Dr. Middleton was in the habit
 of requiring from her an account of the learned conversations at
 which, in his society, she was frequently present; not admitting of
 the excuse of her tender age as a disqualification, but insisting
 that although at the present time she could but imperfectly
 understand their meaning, she would in future derive great benefit
 from the habit of attention inculcated by this practice.”

    [7] Conyers Middleton, D.D., born 1683, died 1750. Fellow of Trinity
    College, Cambridge, etc., etc. Wrote the “Life of Cicero,” etc.,
    etc.

    [8] “The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu,” by her nephew, Matthew
    Montagu, afterwards 4th Baron Rokeby.

Her father was proud of her vivacious wit, and encouraged her gifts of
repartee which she possessed in as large a measure as himself.

 “In her youth her beauty was most admired in the peculiar animation
 and expression of her blue eyes, with high arched eyebrows, and
 in the contrast of her brilliant complexion with her dark brown
 hair. She was of the middle stature, and stooped a little, which
 gave an air of modesty to her countenance, in which the features
 were otherwise so strongly marked as to express an elevation of
 sentiment befitting the most exalted condition.”

[Year: 1727–28]

Her elder brothers, members of Cambridge University, were all extremely
literary, and became, early, distinguished scholars. We are told--

 “Their emulation produced a corresponding zeal in their sisters,
 and a diligence of application unusual in females of that time.
 Their domestic circle was accustomed to struggle for the mastery
 in wit, or in superiority in argument, and their mother, whose
 frame of mind partook rather of the gentle sedateness of good sense
 than of the eccentricities of genius, was denominated by them ‘the
 Speaker,’ from the frequent mediation by which she moderated their
 eagerness for victory.”

[Page heading: MOUNT MORRIS]

[Page heading: LADY MARGARET CAVENDISH HARLEY]

In Harris’s “History of Kent,” published in 1719, on p. 156, is a
picture of Mount Morris, the home of the Robinsons, a large square
house with a cupola surmounted by a ball and a weathercock, surrounded
by a number of walled gardens laid out in the formal Dutch manner, an
inner Topiary garden, leading to a steep flight of steps to the front
door. Whilst staying in Cambridgeshire, Elizabeth had several times
visited at Wimpole with her father and mother. Wimpole was the seat
of Edward,[9] second Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, who had married
Henrietta Cavendish, only daughter and heiress of John Holles, 1st Duke
of Newcastle-on-Tyne. She was a great heiress, and brought her husband
£500,000; she is said to have been a good but a very dull woman, very
proud, and a rigid worshipper of etiquette. In the “National Biography”
she is said to have “disliked most of the wits who surrounded her
husband, and hated _Pope_!”[10] The Earl spent enormous sums in
collecting books, manuscripts, pictures, medals, and articles of virtu,
spending £400,000 of his wife’s fortune. To him we are indebted for
the Harleian manuscripts, bought from his widow in 1753 for £10,000
by the nation, now in the British Museum. With the Lady Margaret
Cavendish Harley,[11] only child of the Earl and Countess of Oxford,
Elizabeth became on the most intimate terms, and her first extant
letter is addressed to her when she was only eleven years old, and the
Lady Margaret eighteen. So greatly did Lady Margaret value Elizabeth’s
letters, that for a series of years she preserved them between the
leaves of an old grey book which I possess. The first letter is
endorsed, “Received, February 24, 1731–2, at Wimpole.” It commences--

  “MADAM,

 “Your ladyship’s commands always give me a great deal of pleasure,
 but more especially when you ordered me to do myself this honour,
 without which I durst not have taken that liberty, for it would
 have been as great impertinence in me to have attempted it as it is
 condescension in your ladyship to order it.”

This alludes evidently to Lady Margaret having desired her to write to
her. It ends--

 “My duty to my Lord and Lady Oxford, and service to Lord
 Dupplin,[12] and my best respects to Miss Walton,[13] hope in a
 little while it may be duty. I am in great hopes that when your
 ladyship sees any impertinent people in London it will put you in
 mind of, Madam,

 “Your ladyship’s most obliged, humble servant,

  “ELIZ. ROBINSON.”

    [9] Lord Oxford sold Wimpole in 1740 to Lord Hardwick to pay off his
    debts.

    [10] Pope was his bosom friend, Swift and Prior also; the latter
    died at Wimpole.

    [11] Prior celebrated the Lady Margaret in the lines commencing “My
    noble, lovely, little Peggy.”

    [12] Afterwards 8th Earl of Kinnoul.

    [13] Lady Margaret’s governess, about to be married.

[Illustration: MOUNT MORRIS.]

[Year: 1731–32]

The formal terms in this letter were then considered essential, even
when addressing those of lower birth, all the more so to a person of
Lady Margaret’s rank. Viscount Dupplin, whose name frequently occurs in
the letters, was a cousin of Lady Margaret’s on her father’s side, his
mother being a daughter of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford. The two
young friends now kept up a lively correspondence, but as many of the
letters have been published by my grandfather in 1810, I shall for this
early period of her life give only a _résumé_ of them, picking out such
facts as point to the manners of the time, or that strike one as of
interest. From Mount Morris in August, 1732, she writes--

 “Since I came here I have been to Canterbury Races, at which there
 was not much diversion, as only one horse ran for the King’s
 Plate.... We had an assembly for three nights; the rooms are so
 small and low that they were exceedingly hot.”

From this date one perceives that young ladies were allowed to appear
in public early, as Elizabeth was then not quite twelve years old!

[Year: 1733]

[Page heading: TUNBRIDGE WELLS]

In October, 1733, she paid, in company of her parents, her first visit
to Tunbridge Wells, ever afterwards such a favourite resort of hers.
She says--

 “It is so pleasant a place I don’t wonder the physicians prescribe
 it as a cure for the spleen; a great part of the company,
 especially of the gentlemen, are vapoured. When the wind is not in
 the east they are very good company, but they are as afraid of an
 easterly wind as if it would bring caterpillars upon our land as
 it did on the land of Egypt.... I am very sorry I could not get
 you any verses at Tunbridge, of which, at the latter part of the
 season, when the garrets grow cheap, that the poets come down,
 there is commonly great plenty.”

Further on she says, “I thank your ladyship for the verses, and I wish
I had any to send you in return for them, but my poet is turned lawyer,
and has forsook the Muses for ‘Coke upon Littleton.’” This alludes to
her brother Tom, who was then studying law. The collecting of verses on
every sort of circumstance seems to have been as fashionable then as
photograph, autograph, or stamp-collecting, etc., are now.

[Page heading: “MRS.” PLACE]

In the next letter of November, 1733, she alludes to Dr. Conyers
Middleton, who, as stated before, had married Mrs. Drake, Elizabeth’s
grandmother, and who was now a widower--

 “I suppose you have heard Dr. Middleton has brought his Cousin
 Place[14] to keep his house. He very gravely sent us word that
 his cousin had come to spend the winter with him, and it was not
 impossible they might agree for a longer time; so I fancy he has
 brought her with him to see if she likes to play at quadrille, and
 sup on sack posset with the grave doctors, whose company to one of
 her gay temper must be delightful. I suspected his designs when he
 made so many complaints in London, that it was so very difficult to
 find a maid who understood making jellies and sack posset, which he
 and a certain doctor used to have for their suppers. He lost one
 lady because she was deaf to him; but I believe that fortune, to
 make amends to him, has blinded this. For though I don’t doubt he
 always takes care to show her the side of his face which Mr. Doll
 says is younger by ten years than the other, yet that is rather too
 old to be a match for twenty-five, which I believe is the age of
 Mrs.[15] Place.”

    [14] Mary, daughter of the Rev. Conyers Place, of Dorchester. She
    died April 26, 1745.

    [15] It was the custom at this time to give spinster ladies the
    complimentary title of “Mrs.”

The next letter she says--

 “I have not heard from Dr. Middleton a great while. I suppose his
 thoughts are taken up with business and his pretty cousin in the
 West. I don’t know whether she has made a complete conquest of his
 heart.”

In May, 1733--

 “Dr. Middleton now owns his marriage. I wish he finds the felicity
 of it answers his resigning a £100 a year. I am glad, for the sake
 of any other family, he has not got another rich widow; if he had,
 it would have been her turn to resign.”

This alludes to the fact that on the learned doctor’s remarriage he had
to resign his fellowship.

[Page heading: MR. ROBINSON]

Mr. Robinson, Elizabeth’s father, was not fond of the country, where
his wife’s fine estate and his nine children condemned him to reside
the greater part of the year; and when we consider how young a man he
was, then only thirty-one, and his great love of witty society, one
cannot be surprised at his having attacks of the “hyp” or “vapours,” as
the terms for ennui were then. Elizabeth writes to Lady Margaret from
Mount Morris--

 “Though I am tired of the country, to my great satisfaction I
 am not so much so as my Pappa; he is a little vapoured, and
 last night, after two hours’ silence, he broke out with a great
 exclamation against the country, and concluded in saying that
 living in the country was sleeping with one’s eyes open. If he
 sleeps all day, I am sure he dreams much of London. What makes
 this place more dull is, my brothers are none of them here; two of
 them went away about a fortnight ago, and ever since my Pappa has
 ordered me to put a double quantity of saffron[16] in his tea.”

    [16] Saffron, said to be good for heaviness of spirits.

[Year: 1734]

February 11, 1734, she writes--

 “Dr. Middleton sends us word my Pappa’s acquaintance wonder he has
 not the spleen, but they would cease their surprise if they knew he
 was so much troubled with it that his physicians cannot prescribe
 him any cordial strong enough to keep up his spirits. We think
 London would do it effectually, and I believe he will have recourse
 to it.”

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF PORTLAND]

On July 11, 1734, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley married William,
2nd Duke of Portland.[17] There are no letters of Elizabeth’s in my
possession on the occasion of her friend’s marriage; they recommence
October 20 in the same year. Henceforward all the duchess’s letters
were franked by the duke, and many of Elizabeth’s, often unfortunately
undated. At this period ladies prevailed on such of their friends
as were either Peers or members of Parliament, to sign sheets of
letter-paper with their names at the back, often of folio size, which
they used free of cost as they wanted them, wrapping their letters in
these outer sheets and sealing them. As a single letter from London to
Edinburgh cost 1_s._ 1½_d._, if double 2_s._ 3_d._, and if treble 3_s._
4½_d._, the smallest inclosure being treated as an additional sheet,
to send letters unfranked was a costly luxury. The practice of forging
people’s names led to such intolerable abuse of franking that an Act
was passed in 1764 making it compulsory for the whole address to be
written by the person franking the letter.

    [17] William, 2nd Duke of Portland, born 1708, died 1762. Hearne, in
    his Diary, says, “Is reported the handsomest man in England.”

In October, the same year, Elizabeth replies to a letter from the
duchess chiding her for not writing--

 “_Oct. 3, 1734._--I am surprised that my answer to your Grace’s
 letter has never reached your hands. I sent it immediately to
 Canterbury by the servant of a gentleman who dined here, and
 I suppose he forgot to put it in the post. I am reconciled to
 the carelessness of the fellow, since it has procured to me so
 particular a mark of your concern. If my letter were sensible,
 what would be the mortification, that instead of having the honour
 to kiss your Grace’s hands, it must lie confined in the footman’s
 pocket with greasy gloves, rotten apples, a pack of dirty cards,
 and the only companion of its sort, a tender epistle from his
 sweetheart, ‘tru tell deth.’ Perhaps by its situation subject to be
 kicked by his master every morning, till at last, by ill-usage and
 rude company, worn too thin for any other use, it may make its exit
 in lighting a tobacco-pipe. I believe the fellow who lost my letter
 knew very well how ready I should be to supply it with another.

  “I am, Madam,
  “Your Grace’s most obedient servant,
  “ELIZABETH ROBINSON.”

[Page heading: “FIDGET”]

The duchess’s favourite name for Elizabeth was “Fidget,” a name adopted
by all the Bullstrode[18] circle. This was due to her vivacity of mind
and body. She was never really a strong person, but her nervous energy
enabled her frail body to perform feats that a more lethargic person
could not have accomplished. “Why should a table that stands still
require so many legs when I can fidget on two?” she would exclaim. The
duchess returns an answer on October 25, portions of which I copy--

  “DEAR FIDGET,

 “I assure you I am very angry at the fellow’s not taking care of
 your letter, for they always give me infinite pleasure, and I
 esteem it as a great loss. I am very sensible of the friendship
 you have for me, and hope you never shall find any reason to the
 contrary. You have painted extremely well the fate of your letter
 was not according to its deserts.... Pray do you hear anything of
 Dr. Middleton and his fine wife?[19] I had a letter not long ago
 wherein it was said she made the doctor very sensible she had a
 tongue, and a very sharp one too, with the addition of a clear and
 distinct voice. If you have any poetry, send it to me; you know it
 will be acceptable to her who is

  “Dear Fidget’s
  “Very humble servant and admirer,
  “M. CAVENDISH PORTLAND.”

    [18] The duchess always spelt Bullstrode with the double _l_, from
    the story of the place, and I choose to do the same.

    [19] On Dr. Middleton’s second wife.

[Page heading: DRAWING LESSONS]

In Elizabeth’s next letter, November 3, 1734, she regrets that her
father, having recovered his spirits, had given up going to Bath as
projected, and says--

 “One common objection to the country, one sees no faces but those
 of one’s own family, but my Pappa thinks he has found a remedy for
 that by teaching me to draw; but then he husbands these faces in
 so cruel a manner that he brings me sometimes a nose, sometimes an
 eye at a time: but on the King’s birthday, as it was a festival, he
 brought me out a whole face with its mouth wide open. Your Grace
 desired me to send you some verses; I have not heard so much as a
 Rhyme lately, and I believe the Muses have all got agues in this
 country, but I have enclosed you the following Summons which we
 sent an old bachelor, who is very much our humble servant, and
 would die but not dance for us; but being once in great necessity
 for partners, we thought him better than an elbow chair, and
 compelled him to come to this Summons, which pleased me extremely,
 as I believe it was the first time he ever found the power of
 the fair sex.... I am so far from Cambridge, and have no friend
 charitable enough to send me any scandal, I have heard nothing of
 either of the doctors, but as to my dear grandmother,[20] I have
 before heard she was as famous as a _free speaker_ as he is for a
 _free-thinker_.[21]

    [20] This is Elizabeth’s fun, as her own grandmother was dead, and
    the doctor was her step-grandfather.

    [21] Dr. Middleton held free-thinking views on the Old Testament.


[Page heading: A SUMMONS]

 “‘SUMMONS.

 “‘_Kent, to J. B., Esqre._[22]

 “‘WHEREAS complaint has been made to us Commissioners of Her
 Majesties’ Balls, Hopps, Assemblies, &c., for the county aforesaid,
 that several able and expert men, brought up and instructed in
 the art or mistery of Dancing, have and daily do refuse, though
 often thereunto requested, to be retained and exercised in the
 aforesaid Art or Mistery, to the occasion of great scarcity of good
 dancers in these parts, and contrary to the Laws of Gallantry and
 good manners, in that case made and provided: AND WHEREAS we are
 likewise credibly informed that you J. B., Esqre., though educated
 in the said Art by that celebrated Master, Lally, Senior, are one
 of the most notorious offenders in this point, these are therefore
 in the name of the Fair Sex, to require you, the said J. B.,
 Esqre., personally to be and appear before us, at our meeting this
 day at the sign of the “Golden Ball,” in the parish of Horton, in
 the county aforesaid, between the hours of twelve and one in the
 forenoon to answer to such matter as shall be objected against you,
 concerning the aforesaid refusal and contempt of our jurisdiction
 and authority, and to bring with you your dancing shoes, laced
 waistcoat and white gloves. And hereby fail not under peril of our
 frowns, and being henceforth deemed and accounted an Old Bachelor.
 Given under our hands and seals this eighth day of October, 1734,
 to which we all set our hands.’”

    [22] James Brockman, of Beachborough. The summons is still kept at
    Beachborough.

[Page heading: THE “GOLDEN BALL”]

The “Golden Ball” was the ball of the weathercock on the lantern cupola
of the house at Mount Morris. In the next letter, November 20, she
says--

 “Out of my filial piety I would persuade my Pappa to set out for
 London. I have been preaching to him all this day, that when Saul
 had the spleen, David’s musick did him a great deal of good, and
 that I am satisfied Farinelli[23] would do him as much service. He
 goes frequently shooting or coursing, and fancies that will prevent
 its return, and to answer me with the Scripture, says, Nimrod the
 mighty hunter never had the Hyp. Dr. Middleton designed to bring
 his Dearee to London, but if she is so gay it may be as prudent
 to keep her at Cambridge ... if it should enter her head that the
 doctor is no greater than another, what a mortification it would
 be to my good Grand-pappa; if he knows himself and her, I think he
 would agree with Arnolfe in _L’Ecole des Femmes_[24]--

    “‘Que c’est assez pour elle, a vous en bien parler,
    De savoir prier Dieu, l’aimer, coudre, et filer.’”

    [23] Carlo Brocchi, whose professional name was Farinelli, vocalist
    and pupil of Porpora.

[Illustration:

  _Emery Walker Ph. Sc._

_Miss Sarah Morris_]

Mr. Robinson, who drew and painted in a style worthy of a professional
artist, was anxious Elizabeth should become a proficient in the same
art, but she writes to the duchess--

 “If you design to make any proficiency in that art, I would
 advise you not to draw _old men’s_ heads. It was the rueful head
 countenance of Socrates or Seneca that first put me out of conceit
 of it; had my Pappa given me the blooming faces of Adonis or
 Narcissus, I might have been a more apt scholar; and when I told
 him I found those great beards difficult to draw, he gave me St.
 John’s head in a charger, so to avoid the speculation of dismal
 faces, which by my art I dismalized ten times more than they were
 before, I threw away my pencil.”

[Year: 1735]

[Page heading: TUNBRIDGE WELLS]

In October, 1735, the duchess’s first child was born, Elizabeth,
eventually wife of the 1st Marquis of Bath. Elizabeth writes to
congratulate her, and states she heard Dr. Mead (then the great ladies’
doctor) pronounced it the finest child he ever saw. Elizabeth had
just returned from her first visit to Tunbridge Wells for her health,
suffering much from headaches and weak eyes. At this period the
_Dowager_ Duchess of Portland died. The letters up to this date were
addressed to “To Her Grace, The junior Duchess of Portland.”

[Page heading: LORD STANHOPE]

Elizabeth writes a description of her five weeks at Tunbridge Wells.
After comments on an unhappy marriage recently made, she says--

 “You know some of our Grub Street wits compared marriage to a
 country dance, which scheme I extremely approved, but when I read
 it, I thought it should have been set to the tune of ‘Love for
 ever;’ but they say it never did go to that tune, nor ever would.
 I danced twice a week all the time I was at Tunbridge, and once
 extraordinary, for Lord Euston[25] came down to see Lord Augustus
 Fitzroy,[26] and made a ball. Lord Euston danced with the Duchess
 of Norfolk,[27] but her Grace went home early, and then Lord Euston
 danced with Lady Delves. We all left off about one o’clock. The day
 after I left the Wells, I went to the Races (Canterbury), which
 began on Monday, and ended on Thursday.... Monday there was an
 Assembly, Tuesday a Play, Wednesday an Assembly again, and Thursday
 another play, and as soon as that was over, we had a ball where we
 had ten couple. I did not go to bed after our private ball till
 six o’clock, and rose again before nine.

 “The person who was taken most notice of at Tunbridge as particular
 is a young gentleman your Grace may be perhaps acquainted with, I
 mean Lord Stanhope.[28] He is always making mathematical scratches
 in his pocket-book, so that one half the people took him for a
 conjurer, and the other half for a fool.”

    [25] George, Earl of Euston, son of the 2nd Duke of Grafton.

    [26] A brother of Lord Euston.

    [27] Wife of Edward, 9th Duke of Norfolk.

    [28] Philip, 2nd Earl Stanhope, born 1714.

In a letter of October 2 is the first mention of Mrs. Pendarves,[29]
afterwards Mrs. Delany. It runs--

 “Your pleasures are always my satisfactions; I assure you I partake
 at Mount Morris all the happiness you tell me you receive at
 Bullstrode. I am sure Mrs. Pendarves cannot give you any pleasure
 in her conversation that she is not repayed in enjoying yours. I
 am glad you have got so agreeable a companion with you; it is a
 happiness you have not always enjoyed, though deserved.”

    [29] _Née_ Mary Granville, widow of Mr. W. Pendarves, born 1700,
    died 1788. Daughter of John Granville.

[Page heading: LADY THANET]

Mention is made of the duchess’s desire to obtain beautiful shells,
and Elizabeth desired her sailor brother Robert, who had just returned
from Italy, and was going in his ship to the East Indies, to bring home
what he can in shells and feathers of all sorts--parrots, peacocks,
etc.--for work the duchess was doing. This feather work became a
rage of both the duchess and Elizabeth, and was the precursor of
the celebrated feather hangings, immortalized by Cowper’s verses in
Elizabeth’s later years. A humorous description of Lady Thanet,[30]
then the great lady of West Kent, an amusing character, and great-aunt
of the Duchess of Portland, is given in the same letter--

 “Lord Thanet[31] said when he came to Kent this summer that Lord
 Cowper[32] had brought his Countess[33] to affront all _East Kent_,
 and he had brought his Countess to affront all _West Kent_. She was
 a little discomposed one day at dinner and threw a pheasant and a
 couple of partridges off the table in shoving them up to my Lord to
 cut up.”

    [30] Mary, 4th daughter and coheiress of 2nd Marquis of Halifax.

    [31] 7th Earl of Thanet.

    [32] William, 2nd Earl Cowper.

    [33] Henrietta, daughter of Earl Grantham.

[Year: 1737]

Early in 1737, the second daughter of the duchess’s was
born--Henrietta, afterwards Countess of Stamford and Warrington.
Elizabeth writes to congratulate her on the event. She and her family
were very ill of fever that summer, thirteen persons down with it in
the house. The smallpox raged at Canterbury, and Mrs. Robinson would
not allow her daughters to attend the races. In a letter of September
mention is made of Dr. Conyers Middleton’s disappointment at not
obtaining the Mastership of the Charter House, which he most desired.
Another peep at Lady Thanet--

 “Lady Thanet came into this part of the country ten days ago;
 her French woman rode astride through the wilds of Kent, and the
 country people having heard her Ladyship was something odd, took
 Mademoiselle for Lady Thanet.”

The first letter extant between Elizabeth and Miss Anstey, sister of
Christopher Anstey, the author of the “New Bath Guide,”[34] may be
placed here, though undated, except “Mount Morris, near Hythe, July
15.” This extract shows her vivacious nature--

    [34] The “New Bath Guide” was not written till 1766. The Ansteys
    lived at Brinckley near Cambridge.

 “Yesterday I was overturned coming from a neighbour’s. We got no
 hurt at all, but were forced to borrow a coach to bring us the
 rest of the way, our own being quite disabled by the fall.... I
 always think one visits in the country at the hazard of one’s
 bones, but fear is never so powerful with me, as to make me stay
 at home, and the next thing to being retired, is to be morose:
 contemplation is not made for a woman on the right side of thirty,
 it suits prodigiously well with the gout or the rheumatism: rest
 and an elbow chair are the comfort of age, but the pleasures of
 youth are of a more lively sort. I have in winter gone eight miles
 to dance to the music of a blind fiddler, and returned at two in
 the morning, mightily pleased that I had been so well entertained.
 I am so fond of dancing that I cannot help fancying I was at some
 time bit by a tarantula,[35] and never got well cured of it. I
 shall this year lose my annual dancings at Canterbury Races, for my
 Papa has made a resolution (I assure you without my advice) not to
 go to them.”

    [35] It was believed that a tarantula’s bite was only to be cured by
    dancing.

[Page heading: THE PLAY]

In the next letter to the duchess, October 15, 1737--

 “Lady Thanet made a ball at Hothfield a few days ago to which she
 did our family the honour to invite them, and as we were obeying
 her commands and got into the coach with our ball airs and our
 dancing shoes, at five miles of our journey we met with a brook so
 swelled by the rain it looked like a river, and the water, we were
 told, was up to the coach seat, and as I had never heard of any
 balls in the Elysian Fields, and don’t so much as know whether the
 ghosts of departed beaux wear pumps, I thought it better to reserve
 ourselves for the Riddotto[36] than hazard drowning for this ball,
 and so we turned back and went to Sir Wyndham Knatchbull’s,[37]
 who were hindered by the same water; for my part I could think of
 nothing but the ball, when any one asked me how I did I cry’d
 tit for tat, and when they bid me sit down, I answered ‘Jack of
 the green.’ A few days after the ball, Lady Thanet bespoke a play
 at a town eight miles from us, and summoned us to it; two of my
 brothers, and my sister,[38] and your humble servant went, and
 after the play the gentlemen invited all the women to a supper
 at a tavern, where we staid till two o’clock in the morning, and
 then all set out for their respective homes. Here I suppose you
 will think my diversion ended, but I must tell your Grace it
 did not; for before I had gone two miles, I had the pleasure of
 being overturned, at which I squalled for joy; and to complete my
 felicity I was obliged to stand half an hour in the most refreshing
 rain, and the coolest north breeze I ever felt; for the coach’s
 braces breaking were the occasion of our overturn, and there was no
 moving till they were mended. You may suppose we did not lose so
 favourable an opportunity of catching cold; we all came croaking
 down to breakfast the next morning, and said we had caught no cold,
 as one always says when one has been scheming, but I think I have
 scarce recovered my treble notes yet. We had seven coaches at the
 play; there was Lord Winchilsea,[39] Lady Charlotte Finch,[40]
 Lady Betty Fielding,[40] Capt. Fielding,[41] his lady, and the
 Miss Palmers.[42] Mr. Fielding and Miss Molly Palmer caught such
 colds they sent for a physician the next day; Lady Knatchbull and
 Miss Knatchbull have kept their beds ever since: poor Lady Thanet
 was overturned as she went home, and caught a terrible hoarseness,
 which was the better for the poor coachman, who by that means
 escaped a sharp and shrill reproof; and indeed it is enough for
 any poor man to lye under the terror of her frowns, with a look
 she can wound, with a frown she can kill; I think I never saw so
 formidable a countenance. I think Lord Thanet’s education of his
 son[43] is something particular; he encourages him in swearing and
 singing nasty ballads with the servants: he is a very fine boy,
 but prodigiously rude; he came down to breakfast the other day
 when there was company, and his maid came with him, who, instead
 of carrying a Dutch toy, or a little whirligig for his Lordship to
 play with, was lugging a billet for his plaything. There was a fine
 supper at the ball, 33 dishes all very neat. My elder brother got
 out of the coach and put on a pair of boots, and rode on to the
 ball when we turned back.”

[Page heading: LADY WALLINGFORD]

November 21, the duchess writes to condole with Elizabeth on the loss
of the ball, and mentions having been staying with the Duke at Lady
Peterborough’s[44]--

 “Bevis Mount[45] is the most delightful place I ever saw, the house
 bad and tumbling down, but there is a summer-house in the garden,
 such a one! From thence there is a prospect of the sea, the Isle
 of Wight, New Forest, the town of Southampton, the garden laid out
 with an elegant taste, and in short everything that is agreeable,
 but particularly the Mistress.... Lord and Lady Wallingford are
 with us now; they are extremely agreeable. I fancy you must have
 seen her in public places. She is extremely pretty, and in the
 French dress.”

    [44] _Née_ Anastasia Robinson, wife of the 3rd Lord Peterborough.

    [45] Bevis Mount, in Southampton.

Lady Wallingford was the daughter of John Law, the famous financier, by
his wife Katherine Knollys, third daughter of Charles Knollys, titular
3rd Earl of Banbury. Mary Katherine Law married in 1732 her first
cousin, called Viscount Wallingford.

[Page heading: THE SUIT OF CLOATHES]

At this period, though undated, may be placed Elizabeth’s request to
her father for a handsome suit of clothes. In a letter to her mother
she thanks her “for your goodness in giving me leave to stay, and
making it convenient to answer the Duchess’s and my wishes to stay
during her confinement. When we came to town the Duchess reckoned the
end of April.” From Bullstrode, therefore, she accompanied the duchess
and her family to Whitehall, where in a portion of the old palace was
the Portlands’ town residence. Elizabeth was now in her eighteenth
year. In a letter to her father, too lengthy to insert entirely, worded
in the respectful way children addressed their parents then, with “Sir”
and “Madam,” and concluding with “your most dutiful daughter,” she
says--

 “You know this year I am to be introduced by the Duchess to the
 best company in the town, and when she lies in, am both to receive
 in form with her all her visits as Lady Bell[46] used to do on
 that occasion, all the people of quality of both sexes that are in
 London, and I must be in full dress, and shall go about with her
 all the winter, therefore a suit of cloathes will be necessary for
 me, the value of which I submit entirely to you. I shall never so
 much want a handsome suit as upon this occasion of first appearing
 with my Lady Duchess; but as the first consideration is to please
 you, I would by no means urge this beyond your pleasure, by duty
 or inclination, I shall always be content with what you order, and
 hope you will not be displeased with my requests.”

    [46] Lady Isabella Bentinck, sister of the duke.

To this appeal her father sent her £20, and she returns thanks thus:--

  “Whitehall, Thursday.

  “SIR,

 “Wit is seldom accompanied with money, but your letter came to
 me with so much of both, that I can neither send you thanks, nor
 an answer worthy of your present epistle. You are very good
 to gratify my bosom friend, vanity, which, though it does not
 abandon me in a plain gown, takes greater delight in seeing me
 in a handsome one, and it has promised me that I shall appear to
 advantage in my new suit of cloathes, both to myself and other
 people.... The Duchess, with her advice, will help me to make the
 best use of your generosity. I have been to the Mercer’s, but have
 not yet pitched upon a silk.... Mr. Pope has wrote an epitaph upon
 himself, which is not by far the best monument of his wit; it is
 a trifling thing, and seems wrote for amusement. I would send it
 you if I could, but I have not got a copy of it; as soon as I have
 I will convey it to Mount Morris, where I imagine you may want
 amusements, and our roads are not smooth enough for Pegasus.”

[Page heading: ROBERT ROBINSON]

This epitaph is probably the one commencing “Under this marble, or
under this sill, or under this turf, or e’en what they will.” At the
end of the letter she says of her sailor brother--

 “Now Robert is secure of his commission, his life is something
 hazardous, but he holds danger in contempt, the golden fruit of
 gain is always guarded by some dragon which courage or vigilance
 must conquer.”

He had just been made captain of the _Bedford_, a ship in the merchant
service. Evidently Mrs. Robinson wrote a letter of advice as to the
important choice of “cloathes.” The answer runs--

  “MADAM,

 “I have obeyed your commands as to my cloathes, and have bought a
 very handsome Du Cape within the twenty pounds; a little accident
 which had happened to the silk in the Lomb made it a great deal
 cheaper, and, I believe, will not be at all the worse when made up;
 the colour in some places is a little damaged, but that will cut
 for the tail, and the rest is perfectly good. It will last longer
 clean than a flowered silk, and I have already had two since I
 have been in Mantuas:[47] I saw some of 25_s._ a yard that I did
 not think so pretty. Pray, Madam, let my thanks be repeated to my
 Pappa, to whose goodness I owe this suit of cloathes.... Pray send
 me by Tom the figured Dimity that was left of my upper coat, for it
 is too narrow and too short for my present hoop, which is of the
 first magnitude.”

    [47] The expression then used for the period when young ladies were
    what we call “out.”

[Page heading: ANNE DONNELLAN]

At the end of this letter Anne Donnellan is mentioned for the first
time. She was a friend of Dean Swift’s, together with her sister,
Mrs. Clayton, and her brother, the Rev. Christopher Donnellan. Anne
Donnellan’s pet name in the Duchess of Portland’s circle was “Don,”
as Mrs. Pendarves (afterwards Mrs. Delany) was “Pen,” Miss Dashwood
“Dash,”[48] and Lady Wallingford “Wall.”

CHAPTER II.

LIFE IN BATH, LONDON, AND AT BULLSTRODE, 1738–1740 BEGINNING OF
CORRESPONDENCE WITH MRS. DONNELLAN.


[Year: 1738]

On April 16, 1738, the Duchess of Portland’s son, William Henry,
afterwards 3rd Duke, was born, after which Elizabeth returned home
with her father. On June 30 the duchess wrote to apologize for a long
silence--

 “I should have answered dear Fidget’s letter before I left
 London, but you are sensible what a hurry one lives in there,
 and particularly after being confined some months from public
 diversions, how much one is engaged in them, Operas, Park,
 Assemblies, Vaux Hall--which I believe you never had the occasion
 of seeing. You must get your Papa to stay next year: it is really
 insufferable going out of town at the most pleasant time of the
 year. I am positive the easterly winds have much greater effect
 upon the spirits in the country, than it is possible they should
 have in London. I dare say the chief part of the year your Papa is
 in town he don’t know which way the wind is, except when he goes
 into a Coffee House and meets with some poor disbanded Officer who
 is quarrelling with the times and consequently with the weather,
 because he is not a General in time of peace; or a valetudinarian,
 that if a fly settled on his nose, would curse the Easterly wind,
 and fancy it had sent it there; these are the only people that ever
 thought of East wind in London.”

At the end of the letter the duchess says, “My amusements are all of
the Rural kind--Working, Spinning, Knotting, Drawing, Reading, Writing,
Walking, and picking Herbs to put into an Herbal.”

[Page heading: SIR ROBERT AUSTIN]

This little peep of her life is most characteristic, though fond
of the pleasures of high society diversions, and the varieties of
London, she took an interest in all sorts of country and domestic
pursuits, and excelled in them. She turned in wood and ivory; she
was familiar with every kind of needlework; she made shell frames,
adorned grottoes, designed feather work, collected endless objects in
the animal and vegetable kingdom; was a hearty lover of animals and
birds of all kinds. Her letters are lively and affectionate, but not
clever and witty as her friend Elizabeth Robinson’s. She complains of
her stupidity in letter-writing. Elizabeth had the witty head, and the
duchess the cunning hand, but both possessed that valuable possession,
warm hearts. To the duchess’s last letter Elizabeth replies--

 “I arrived at Mount Morris rather more fond of society than
 solitude. I thought it no very agreeable change of scene from
 Handel[49] and Cafferelli.[50]... Sir Francis Dashwood’s sister is
 going to be married to Sir Robert Austin, a baronet of our county;
 if the size of his estate bore any proportion to the bulk of his
 carcase, he would be one of the greatest matches in England ... a
 lady may make her lover languish till he is the size she most likes
 ... as it is the fashion for men to die for love, the only thing
 a woman can do is to bring a man into a consumption; what triumph
 then must attend the lady who reduces Sir Robert Austin ... to
 asses’ milk. Omphale made Hercules spin, but greater glory awaits
 the lady who makes Sir Robert Austin lean.... I told my Pappa how
 much he laid under your Grace’s displeasure for hurrying out of
 town: but what is a fine lady’s anger, or the loss of London, to
 five and forty? They are more afraid of an easterly wind than a
 frown when at that age.”

    [49] George Frederick Handel, born 1685, died 1759.

    [50] Gaetano Majoriano Caffarelli, celebrated Italian singer, pupil
    of Porpora, died 1783.

[Page heading: VARIOUS RECIPES]

[Page heading: THE GOAT]

On December 17 Elizabeth writes to the duchess in answer to a string of
queries the latter had sent her--

 “I must take the liberty to advise what is to be done, and to avoid
 confusion will take them in the order of the letter. Item, for the
 wet-nurse[51] after the chickenpox, that she may become new milch
 again, a handful of Camomile flowers, a handful of Pennyroyal,
 boiled in white wine, and sweetened with treacle, to be taken at
 going to rest. For my Lord Titchfield who grows prodigiously,
 Daisy roots and milk. For the small foot and taper ancle of my
 Lady Duchess, bruised and strained by a fall, a large shoe and oil
 Opodeldock. For the horse whose Christian name I have forgotten,
 Friar’s Balsam, and for the death of a dormouse take four of the
 fairest Moral and Theological Virtues, with patience and fortitude,
 quantum sufficit, and they will prevent immoderate grieving.... I
 heard a very ridiculous story a few days ago: Mr. Page, brother to
 Sir Gregory, going to visit Mr. Edward Walpole,[52] a tame goat
 which was in the street followed him unperceived when he got out
 of the coach into the house. Mr. Walpole’s servant, thinking the
 goat came out of Mr. Page’s coach, carried it into the room to Mr.
 Walpole, who thought it a little odd Mr. Page should bring such a
 visitor, as Mr. Page no less admired at his choice of so savoury a
 companion; but civility, a great disguiser of sentiments, prevented
 their declaring their opinions, and the goat, no respecter of
 persons or furniture, began to rub himself against the frame of a
 chair which was carved and gilt, and the chair, which was fit for
 a Christian, but unable to bear the shock of a beast, fell almost
 to pieces. Mr. Walpole thought Mr. Page very indulgent to his dear
 crony the goat, and wondering he took no notice of the damage,
 said he fancied tame goats did a great deal of harm, to which the
 other said he believed so too: after much free and easy behaviour
 of the goat, to the great detriment of the furniture, they came to
 an explanation, and Mr. Goat was turned downstairs with very little
 ceremony or good manners.... Dr. Middleton has got two nieces whom
 he is to keep entirely, for his brother left them quite destitute.
 They are very fine children, and my Grannam is very fond of them.
 The doctor is soon to bring forth his ‘Cicero,’ everybody says the
 production will do him credit. Lady Thanet has set an assembly on
 foot about eight miles from hence, where we all meet at the full
 moon and dance till 12 o’clock, and then take an agreeable journey
 home. Our assembly in full glory has ten coaches at it; and Lady
 Thanet, to make up a number, is pleased in her humility to call
 in all the parsons, apprentices, tradesmen, apothecaries, and
 farmers, milliners, mantua-makers, haberdashers of small wares,
 and chambermaids. It is the oddest mixture you can imagine--here
 sails a reverent parson, there skips an airy apprentice, here
 jumps a farmer, and then every one has an eye to their trade; the
 milliner pulls you by the hand till she tears your glove; the
 mantua-maker treads upon your petticoat till she unrips the seams;
 the shoemaker makes you foot it till you wear out your shoes; the
 mercer dirties your gown; the apothecary opens the window behind
 you to make you sick. Most of our neighbours will be in town by
 the next moon, so we shall have no more balls this winter. In
 town the ladies talk of their stars, but here, ‘If weak women go
 astray, the moon is more in fault than they.’ Will o’ Whisp never
 led the bewildered traveller over hedge or ditch as a moon does us
 country folk; a squeaking fiddle is an occasion, and a moonlight
 night an opportunity, to go ten miles in bad roads at any time.
 I must tell your Grace that my Papa forgets twenty years and nine
 children, and dances as nimbly as any of the Quorum, but is now
 and then mortified by hearing the ladies cry, ‘Old Mr. Robinson
 hay sides, and turn your daughter:’ other ladies who have a mind
 to appear young say, ‘Well, there is my poor Grandpapa; he could
 no more dance so.’ Then comes an old bachelor of fifty and shakes
 him by the hand, and cries, ‘Why you dance like us young fellows:’
 another more injudicious than the rest, says by way of compliment,
 ‘Who would think you had six fine children taller than yourself? I
 protest if I did not know you I should take you to be young.’ Then
 says the most antiquated Virgin in the company, ‘Mr. Robinson wears
 mighty well; my mother says he looks as well as ever she remembers
 him; he used often to come to the house when I was a girl.’ You may
 suppose he has not the ‘hyp’ at these balls; but indeed it is a
 distemper so well bred as never to come but when people are at home
 and at leisure.”

    [51] Wet-nurse of the Marquis of Titchfield.

    [52] Son of Sir Robert and brother of Horace Walpole.

[Year: 1739]

[Page heading: WILLIAM AND GRACE FREIND]

In April, 1739, Elizabeth’s cousin, Grace Robinson, sister of “Long”
Sir Thomas Robinson,[53] married the Rev. William Freind,[54] son of
the Rev. Dr. Robert Freind, Head Master of Westminster School. Soon
after the marriage, Elizabeth, who appears to have known Mr. Freind
intimately before he married her cousin, writes from “Leicester
Street, near Leicester Fields,” to Mr. and Mrs. Freind, “How rare meet
now, such pairs in love and honour joyn’d,” and addresses them as
“my inestimable cousins.” She states that her family return to Kent
shortly, whilst she is going to the Duchess of Portland in White Hall.
Elizabeth writes to the duchess on July 1, 1739, having just returned
home from her visit--

 “I have thought of nothing but the company I was in on Tuesday
 since I left town, though a worshipful Justice with a new leathern
 belt, scarlet waistcoat and plush breeches, has been endeavouring
 this whole afternoon to put you out of my head. I have been forced
 to hear the most elegant encomiums upon the country, and the most
 barbarous censures upon the town. First his Worship talked of
 Larks and Nightingales, then enlarged upon the sweetness of bean
 blossom, roses and honeysuckles, said the town stunk of cabbages
 and limekilns, so that I found as to pleasures he was lead by the
 nose.”

    [53] Sir Thomas Robinson, eldest son of William Robinson, of Rokeby;
    made a baronet in 1730. Called “Long” Sir Thomas to distinguish him
    from Sir Thomas Robinson, afterwards 1st Baron Grantham.

    [54] Succeeded his father as Rector of Whitney, Oxon, and afterwards
    Dean of Canterbury.

[Page heading: COUNTRY BEAUX]

Further on she says, the Canterbury Races were to be on July 18, and
begs her Grace, if she knows any dancing shoes which lye idle, to bid
them trip to Canterbury, as there will be many forsaken damsels--

 “Our collection of men is very antique, they stand in my list thus:
 a man of sense, a little rusty, a beau a good deal the worse for
 wearing, a coxcomb extremely shattered, a pretty gentleman, very
 insipid, a baronet very solemn, a squire very fat, a fop much
 affected, a barrister learned in ‘Coke upon Lyttelton’ but knows
 nothing of ‘long ways for many as will,’ an heir-apparent, very
 awkward; which of these will cast a favourable eye upon me I don’t
 know.”

[Page heading: THOMAS ROBINSON]

[Page heading: A BONE-SETTER]

She was destined not to go after all, for she writes--

  “Mount Morris, July 18, 1739.

  “MADAM,

 “The great art of life is to turn our misfortunes to our advantage,
 and to make even disappointments instrumental to our pleasures. To
 follow which rule I have taken the day which I should have gone
 to the Races to write to your Grace. About ten days ago my Papa
 took an hypochondriacal resolution not to go to the Races, for the
 Vapours and Love are two things that seek solitude, but for me, who
 have neither in my constitution, a crowd is not disagreeable, and
 I always find myself prompted by a natural benevolence and love
 of Society to go where two or three are gathered together.... The
 theory of dancing is extreamly odd, tho’ the practice is agreeable;
 who could by force of reasoning find out the satisfaction of
 casting off right hand and left, and the Hayes; we often laugh at
 a kitten turning round in pursuit of its tail, when the creature
 is really turning single. I shall have an account of the Races
 from my brother Robinson, who is there; as for the Barrister,[55]
 he came down to the Sessions, and when he had sold all his Law,
 packed up his saleable eloquence and carried it back to Lincoln’s
 Inn, there to be left till called for. Would you think a person so
 near akin to me as a brother could run away from a ball? I hear
 some Canterbury girls who could aspire no higher than a younger
 brother, are very angry, and say they shall never put their cause
 into his hands, as he seems so little willing to defend it....
 Next year we must certainly go to the Races for the good of the
 county, and dance out of the spirit of Patriotism. The Election
 year always brings company to Canterbury upon this occasion, and
 as for me I will dance to either a Whig or a Tory tune, as it may
 be, for in any wise I will dance. I am not like the dancing Monkies
 who will only cut their capers for King George, I will dance for
 any man or Monarch in Christendom, nay were it even a Mahometan
 or idolatrous King; I should not make much scruple about it. I
 had the misfortune to be overturned the other day coming from Sir
 Wyndham Knatchbull’s,[56] the occasion of it was one of our wheels
 coming off. I assure you I but just avoided the indecency of being
 topsy turvey, my head was so much lower than its usual situation,
 as put my ideas much out of place, and I think my head has been
 in a perfect litter ever since.... I shall begin to think from
 my frequent overturns a bone-setter a necessary part of equipage
 for country visiting. I am sure those who visit much, love their
 neighbours better than themselves; perhaps you will be as apt to
 suspect me as anybody of that extream of charity, but I am so
 tender of myself there are few I would hazard even a gristle or
 a sinew, but civility is a debt that must be paid. I hope in all
 accidents I shall preserve a finger and thumb, to write myself

  “Your Grace’s most obedient and obliged
  “Humble servant,
  “E. ROBINSON.

 “My humble service to the Duke.”

    [55] Her brother Thomas.

[Page heading: DUKE OF PORTLAND]

The duchess was now expecting her confinement, and Lady Wallingford,
who was staying with her, corresponded with Elizabeth in French. Owing
to the residence of her father in France as Superintendent of Finances,
she was more French than English. Her letters are well written and
expressed, though the spelling is peculiar. At a later date she writes
to Elizabeth in broken English, and she scolds her for making her
correspond in English instead of French. Horace Walpole, in a letter
to the Earl of Buchan, states that Lady Wallingford was the image of
her father, and that her mother, Lady Katherine Law, lived during her
husband’s power in France in great state. On July 26, 1739, another
daughter, Lady Margaret, was born to the duchess. Dr. Sandys was, as
usual, the accoucheur, but it makes one horrified in these days to
think Dr. Sandys _bled_ the duchess for a feverish cold on the Monday
and Thursday after her child was born. Truly under this San Grado
treatment it was then the “survival of the fittest”! The duke now wrote
a bulletin of his wife to Elizabeth--

  “Whitehall, August 9, 1739.

  “MADAM,

 “Tho’ J have not been overturned you’ll imagine by the scrawl you
 receive yt both my thumb and forefinger have been dislocated; J own
 j can’t agree with you in yt for j flatter myself j have the use of
 them, but if you please j’ll agree with you that they never were in
 joint, for which reason j am not so sensible of ye loss of jointed
 fingers, as you might be had yours been broke by the overturn of
 your coach, which accident j hope may never happen to you. The Dss.
 is as well as can be expected tho’ a little weak, and is extremely
 obliged to you for your letter, and also begged j would hint yt
 tho’ she can’t wright letters she can read them, j need not explain
 my meaning to you. She desires her kind service to Fidgett; and
 should be glad if you would make her compliments acceptable to your
 Mama, etc.

  “j am with the uttmost respect, Madam,
  “Your most obedient, humble servant,
  “PORTLAND.”

The duke’s writing is very characteristic, but certainly rather
disjointed looking, and his I’s always written as long j’s.

Elizabeth had just had another coach adventure. The coachman who drove
her father and mother and her brother Matthew home after dining at a
neighbour’s, was drunk, which they did not perceive till he lashed the
four horses into a furious gallop. In vain Mr. Robinson called to him,
and swore at him; Matthew and Mrs. Robinson intreated; he persisted
in lashing the horses till he fell off the box, and two wheels ran
over him, but as Elizabeth states, “being preserved in beer, took very
little harm; both footmen were drunk, so took very little care about
us.”

In a letter to the duchess (August 15) we find Elizabeth and her sister
Sarah banished from home to Canterbury on account of a woman and three
children who lived in a farmhouse near the gate of Mount Morris having
the smallpox. That fell disease ever inspired Elizabeth with great
dread. Later in life at three different times she was inoculated,[57]
each time unsuccessfully, for this disease, then a universal scourge.
I should like the foolish fathers and mothers of the present day who
petition for non-vaccination to read the accounts given in letters
I possess of the unbridled ravages then made by smallpox, and to
consider that a usually temporary inconvenience to the child’s health
is a very trifling infliction compared with a loathsome disease, which
many people fled from nursing, and which even if it did not kill the
sufferers, probably disfigured them for life. The sisters first stayed
with Mrs. Scott,[58] and then with Mrs. Tennison, “wife to a prebend
in this church; there is very little company here, except Deans,
Prebends and Minor Canons, etc., etc.; nothing but messages and visits
from Prebends, Deacons, and the Church militant upon earth.” Later on,
speaking of her brother Matthew’s refusal to leave home on account of
the smallpox, she says, “I have seven brothers, and would not part with
one for a kingdom; and if I had but one, I should be distracted about
him; sure nobody has so many or so good brothers.”

    [57] Lady Mary Wortley Montagu introduced inoculation into England
    in 1721.

    [58] Of Scott’s Hall.

[Page heading: INFLUENZA]

[Page heading: THE SMALLPOX]

Meanwhile the duchess had a return of fever, and was for some days
in great danger. On August 28 Lady Wallingford writes to say she was
out of danger. Influenza was rife then, and Lady Wallingford states
that she had not a single lackey fit to attend her from her house to
Whitehall, but had walked there by herself, though still suffering from
its effects. It was not then called influenza, but from the description
must have been that disease. Eight out of the nine in the farm at
Mount Morris caught the smallpox, and the duke, writing to Elizabeth on
September 15, a bulletin about his wife, adds--

 “Both she and j[59] join in entreating you not to venture yourself,
 and that pretty face of yours, to come within the walls of your
 paternal mansion, and were j in your situation, nothing but
 absolute commands should make me venture myself.”

    [59] The “j” for “I,” characteristic of the duke’s writing.

After her visit to Canterbury, Elizabeth spent a month at Mersham Hatch
with the Knatchbulls. She now became seriously indisposed; her health
was always frail, and she appears to have suffered much from headaches
at this period. In a letter to the duchess she complains--

 “I have swallowed the weight of an Apothecary in medicine, and what
 I am the better for it, except more patient, and less credulous,
 I know not. I have learnt to bear my infirmities and not to trust
 to the skill of Physicians for curing them. I endeavour to drink
 deeply of Philosophy, and to be wise when I cannot be merry, easy
 when I cannot be glad, content with what cannot be mended, and
 patient where there be no redress. The mighty can do no more, and
 the wise seldom do as much.”

On October 10 she announces that she and her mother, who had been
extremely unwell too, had been advised to drink the Bath waters, and
were to be accompanied there by her father. She hopes to see the
duchess on her way to Bath, but bids her tell her porter to admit her,
as she has grown so thin--

 “he will think it is my ghost and shut the door. I shall stay but
 a few days in town and then proceed with my Father and Mother,
 to the waters of life and recovery. My Pappa’s chimney ‘hyp’ will
 never venture to attack him in a public place; it is the sweet
 companion of solitude and the off-spring of meditation, the disease
 of an idle imagination, not the child of hurry and diversion. I
 am afraid that with the gaiety of the place, and the spirits the
 waters give, I shall be perfect Sal-Volatile, and open my mouth
 and evaporate.... I was a month at Hatch, where the good humour of
 the family makes everything agreeable; we had great variety in the
 house--children in cradles, and old women in elbow chairs. I think
 the family may be looked upon as the three tenses, the present,
 past and future.”

[Page heading: COTTAGE LIFE]

On a fresh scare being caused by the illness of her maid, which the
old women of the parish pronounced to be smallpox, Mrs. Robinson sent
Elizabeth and Sarah to the cottage of the carpenter hard by without
delay, though so late that Elizabeth writes--

 “I arrived at my new lodging but the moment before it was time to
 go to bed, where I slept pretty well, notwithstanding the goodman
 and his wife snored, the little child cryed, the maid screamed, one
 little boy had whooping cough, another roared with chilblains. The
 furniture of our chamber is extraordinary, the ornamental parts as
 follows:--on the mantelpiece four stone tea-cups, four wineglasses,
 two broken, two leaden cherubims, a piece of looking-glass, with
 a ‘beggerly account of empty bottles,’ as Shakespeare calls it, a
 print of King Charles the Martyr, the woeful ballad of the children
 in the wood, a pious copy of verses entitled ‘the believer’s
 gold chain, or good councell for all men,’ with a resplendent
 brass warming pan, in which my sister is dressing her head to the
 disadvantage of her complexion, and not much to the rectitude of
 her head-dress.”

The alarm proved to be false as to the nature of the maid’s illness,
and they returned the next day to the paternal mansion.

[Page heading: EDMUND CURLL]

On November 12 Elizabeth writes from Bath to her sister a long and
indignant letter upon some poems brought out in the name of Prior. She
says--

 “I got at last this morning the poems just published under
 Prior’s[60] name, brought them home under my arm, locked my
 door, sat me down by my fireside, and opened the book with great
 expectation, but to my disappointment found it to be the most
 wretched trumpery that you can conceive, the production of the
 meanest of Curl’s[61] band of scribblers.”

    [60] Matthew Prior, born 1664, died 1721.

    [61] Edmund Curll, born 1675, died 1747; publisher, etc., ridiculed
    by Pope in the “Dunciad.”

She continues to inveigh against this forgery in eloquent terms, and
towards the end of the letter remarks “that mankind can’t support above
two dead languages at a time, so as to have any tolerable knowledge or
use of them, therefore in all probability Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden,
Prior, and Pope are but short-lived, in comparison of those Methuselahs
the Classicks.”

[Page heading: GRACE FREIND]

The first letter to the duchess from Bath is dated--

  “December 15, Friday, Bath.

  “MADAM,

 “After four days’ journey in very bad roads, I arrived here a
 good deal tired: if Scarron[62] had not been very facetious, my
 countenance had not received the impression of a smile since I
 left Whitehall till my arrival at Bath. I read most of the way,
 but was sometimes taken off ‘Le petit Ragotin’s’ disasters to fear
 those that might happen to la petite Fidget.[63]... morning after
 I arrived, I went to the Ladies’ Coffee House, where I heard of
 nothing but the rheumatism in the shoulder, the sciatica in the
 hip, and the gout in the toe. After these complaints I began to
 fancy myself in the Hospitals or Infirmaries; I never saw such
 an assembly of disorders. I dare say Gay[64] wrote his fable of
 the ‘Court of Death’ from this place. After drinking the waters
 I go to breakfast, and about 12 I drink another glass of water,
 and then dress for dinner; visits employ the afternoon, and we
 saunter away the evening in great stupidity. I think no place can
 be less agreeable. ‘How d’ye do?’ is all one hears in the morning,
 and ‘What’s trumps?’ in the afternoon. Lady Berkshire[65] did us
 the honour of a visit on Wednesday, and inquired much about your
 health. Lord Berkshire[66] is literally speaking laid by the leg,
 which the gout has usurped, for it has ever been a distemper of
 very great quality, and runs in the blood of the Howards. Mr.
 Howard and Mr. Tom Howard,[67] Lord Berkshire’s youngest son, are
 here, as are Mrs. Greville and her daughter; Lady Hereford,[68]
 Lady F. Shirley,[69] Lady Anne Furnese,[70] Lady Anne Finch,[71]
 Lady Widdrington, Miss Windsors, Miss Gage, and I should first
 have said the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk,[72] and Mrs. Howard,
 wife of Brigadier-General Howard; as for the men, except Lord
 Noel Somerset, they are altogether abominable; however, such as
 they are, I must dress for the ball, and I will add a supplement
 to-morrow.

 “P.S.--Madam, you know the _Spectator_ says a woman never speaks
 her mind but in the postscript! Last night produced nothing but
 some bad dancing, except Mr. Southwell,[73] who was overwhelmed
 with congratulatory compliments; in one day he was chose Member,
 made Father to a little daughter, and got a £500 prize in the
 lottery; he seemed in good spirits, and bowed popularly low to all
 his acquaintance.... I believe there is a great circulation of
 company, for the bells are always ringing for somebody to come, or
 tolling for somebody gone. There are many people I have known and
 seen before, but very few whom I care to see again. One person whom
 I like extremely, loves her husband so much better than me, that
 I cannot persuade her to come out. I believe your Grace has often
 heard me speak of Mrs. Freind,[74] who is not at all like Sir Tommy
 her brother. What makes me like her still better is her contempt
 of Matadors.[75] I do not think she ever dreamt of Spadille in
 her life, tho’ most people here prefer its company to their best
 friends.”

    [62] Paul Scarron, born 1610, died 1660; French satirist. Husband of
    Mademoiselle D’Aubigné, afterwards Madame de Maintenon; wrote “Le
    Roman Comique,” etc.

    [63] Her pet-name.

    [64] John Gay, born 1685, died 1732; poet, etc.

    [65] Catherine, daughter of J. Grahame, of Levens, Westmorland.

    [66] 4th Earl of Berkshire.

    [67] Afterwards 6th Earl of Berkshire, and 14th Earl of Suffolk.

    [68] Wife of 6th Viscount.

    [69] Daughter of 1st Earl Ferrers.

    [70] Daughter of 1st Earl Ferrers, by second marriage.

    [71] Daughter of 1st Earl Aylesford.

    [72] Widow of 15th Duke, _née_ Sherburne.

    [73] Son of Sir Thomas Southwell.

    [74] Her cousin, _née_ Grace Robinson.

    [75] Terms used in ombre and quadrille.

[Year: 1740]

In her next letter of January 4, 1740, she says--

 “I should be glad to send you some news, but all the news of the
 place would be like the bills of Mortality, palsy four, gout six,
 fever one, and so on. We hear of nothing but ‘Mr. such-a-one is
 not abroad to-day.’ ‘Oh no,’ says another poor gentleman, ‘he dyed
 to-day.’ Then another cries, ‘My party was made for Quadrille[76]
 to-night, but one of the gentlemen has had a second stroke of the
 palsy and cannot come; there is no depending on people, nobody
 minds engagements.’

 “I beg the favour of your Grace to tell Mrs. Pendarves that I often
 enquire after her from her friend Mrs. Donnellan. I hear there is
 hope of Mrs. Pendarves coming here in March, but I know you will be
 against the journey, so I dare not say how glad I should be to see
 her. I assure we have none like her here.”

    [76] Quadrille, a card-game for four people, played with 40 cards,
    8’s, 9’s, and 10’s discarded.

[Page heading: LORD NOEL SOMERSET]

[Page heading: DOWAGER DUCHESS OF NORFOLK]

Miss Anne Donnellan, who according to the then prevailing custom in
regard to unmarried women beyond extreme youth was called Mrs., was
the daughter of Nehemiah Donnellan, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer
of Ireland, and Martha, _née_ Miss Usher. Her father was dead, and
her mother had, in 1712, remarried the Hon. Philip Percival, brother
to the 1st Lord Egmont. The Donnellans were great friends of Dean
Swift, and Anne and her brother, the Rev. Christopher Donnellan,
were correspondents of his, as can be seen in the printed letters in
“Swift’s Life.” The next letter to the duchess says--

 “Lord Berkshire was wheeled into the rooms on Thursday night, where
 he saluted me with much snuff and civility, in consequence of which
 I sneezed and curtseyed abundantly; as a further demonstration of
 his loving-kindness, he made me play at commerce with him. You
 may easily guess at the charms of a place where the height of my
 happiness is a pair royal at commerce, and a peer of fourscore.
 Last night I took to the more youthful diversion of dancing, and am
 nothing but a fan (which my partner tore), the worse for it; our
 beaux here may make a rent in a woman’s fan, but they never will
 make holes in her heart, for my part Lord Noel Somerset[77] has
 made me a convert from toupets and pumps, to tye wigs and a gouty
 shoe. Ever since my Lord Duke reprimanded me for admiring Lord
 Crawford’s[78] nimble legs, I have resolved to prefer the merit of
 the head to the agility of the heels; and I have made so great a
 progress in my resolution as to like the good sense which limps,
 better than the lively folly which dances. But to my misfortune
 he likes the Queen of Spades so much more than me, that he never
 looks off his cards, though, were I the Queen of Diamonds, he would
 stand a fair chance for me. Lord Aylesford comes to the rooms every
 night like ‘Beau Clincher’ in a blanket: he wears a nasty red rugg
 great coat. The Dowager Duchess of Norfolk bathes, and being very
 tall she had like to have drowned a few women in the Cross Bath,
 for she ordered it to be filled till it reached to her chin, and
 so all those who were below her stature, as well as rank, were
 forced to come out or drown; and finding, according to the Proverb,
 in vain to strive against the stream, they left the bath rather
 than swallow so large a draught of water. I am sorry for the cruel
 separation of your Grace and Miss Dashwood, I believe no one parts
 with their friends with greater reluctance than you do.”

    [77] Afterwards 4th Duke of Beaufort.

    [78] John, 17th Earl of Crawford, and 7th Earl of Lindsay.

On January 25 Elizabeth says, “An unfortunate joint in my hip has been
so troublesome, I could not have believed the rheumatism would attack
so dancing a leg;” and then commenting on Lord Noel Somerset’s recent
engagement to Miss Berkeley[79]--

    [79] Elizabeth Berkeley, daughter of John Symes Berkeley, of Stoke
    Gifford.

 “I think Lord Noel’s wife must be happy, and Miss Berkeley is
 a very deserving woman, and good-natured. Everybody is content
 except those who would have liked the gentleman for themselves....
 A man of merit, and a younger brother is a purchase only for a
 large fortune; as for those who have more merit than wealth,
 they must turn the penny by disposing of their useless virtues
 for riches, the exchange may sometimes be difficult, Virtues not
 being sterling, nor merit the coin of the nation.... Gold is the
 chief ingredient in the composition of worldly happiness. Living
 in a cottage on love is certainly the worst diet and the worst
 habitation one can find out. As for modern marriages they are great
 infringers of the baptismal vow; for ’tis commonly the pomps and
 vanities of this wicked world on one side and the simple lust of
 the flesh on the other side. For my part when I marry I do not
 intend to enlist entirely under the banner of Cupid or Plutus, but
 take prudent consideration and decent inclination for my advisers;
 I like a coach and six extremely, but a strong apprehension of
 repentance would not suffer me to accept it from many who possess
 it....

 “I beg your Grace to make my compliments to Mrs. Pendarves, and
 return my sincere thanks for saying so much in my favour as could
 introduce me to so an agreeable an acquaintance as Mrs. Donnellan.
 I assure you what she says gives pleasure, and what she sings
 delight.”[80]

    [80] Her exquisite singing is mentioned in Mrs. Delany’s Memoirs.

[Page heading: FROST FAIR]

In January, 1740, the weather was so severe, a frost fair was held on
the Thames for weeks together; booths, tents, and shows of all kinds
were the order of the day. In a letter to the duchess this is alluded
to thus:--

 “What will the world come to now the Duchesses drink gin, and
 frequent Fairs? I am afraid your gentlemen did not pledge you, or
 they might have resisted the frost and the fatigue by the strength
 of that comfortable liquor. I want much to know if your Grace got
 a ride in the Flying Coach, which is part of the diversion of a
 Fair.... I am much obliged to your Grace for forming schemes for
 me. If any castles come to my share they must be airy ones, for
 I have no material to build them on Terra Firma. I am not a good
 chimerical architect, and besides I would rather dwell this summer
 in a small room in a certain mansion near Gerrard’s Cross,[81]
 than in the most spacious building I could get. I shall not be
 troublesome to you in town, for our stay here will be so long that
 our family will hardly go down till May. The time will come that we
 shall meet at Philippi.”

    [81] Meaning Bullstrode, which is close to Gerrard’s Cross.

[Page heading: MRS. DONNELLAN]

A letter from Mrs. Donnellan, with whom Elizabeth had struck up a
lively friendship, and entered into a correspondence, is dated from
London, April, 1740, portions of which I copy--

 “Since my last I passed a most agreeable day with your friend and
 mine; the Duke and Duchess of Portland proposed a jaunt into the
 city to see city shows, and were so obliging as to ask me with
 Mrs. Pendarves to be of the party. We were four men, four women:
 our fourth woman was Lady Wallingford, whom I never saw before;
 but she seems good-natured and civil; our four men, the Duke, Lord
 Dupplin, Mr. Achard,[82] and Dr. Shaw,[83] all new to me. We set
 out at ten in two hackney coaches, and stopped at everything that
 had a name between us and the Tower, going and coming, and dined at
 a city Tavern. I am extremely glad your time is fixed for coming
 to us, and that we shall have you a month. You will find the rage
 for whist[84] a little abated, I hope, if the weather and Vaux
 Hall is in its lustre. You are right in quarrelling with the men
 for letting cards take their places in the ladies’ hearts, for I
 dare say they would rather hear the gentlemen say fine things,
 than win a Slam, and it is a want of gallantry in the men that
 runs the women into cards; for something we must have to stir our
 passions, or life seems dull. Your account of Bath folks diverted
 me much.... My present delight is the fine lady who admires and
 hates to excess; she doats on the dear little boy that dances,
 she detests Handel’s Oratorios; indeed she don’t say she admires
 Mademoiselle de Chateauneuf’s kicking the tambourine, till she
 shows herself naked to the waist. She owns it is indecent, but she
 goes constantly to see her. I don’t know whether you have heard of
 the kicking entertainment? I have not seen it, but I have heard it
 very lively described; she kicks twice for the King, and once for
 the audience, to the great edification of the spectators. I suppose
 you have heard of the false dice at the last masquerade. I fancy
 it must have been a pretty sight, a dozen Dominoes, at five in the
 morning examined before Justice de Val: I think they should have
 been all Devils with Horns and Hoofs. I saw the Duke and Duchess
 of Portland yesterday morning at Zincke’s,[85] where she and
 Mrs. Pendarves are sitting for their pictures.... Adieu; make my
 compliments to all your family, and believe me, dear Madam,

  “Your affectionate friend, and humble servant,
  “ANNE DONNELLAN.”

    [82] Mr. Achard had been tutor to the duke, and was afterwards his
    secretary.

    [83] Dr. Shaw, born 1692, died 1751; Regius Professor of Greek,
    Oxford. Great traveller, botanist, etc.

    [84] Elizabeth hated games of cards.

    [85] Christian Frederick Zincke, born 1684, died 1767; eminent
    miniature painter.

[Page heading: THE PLUNGE BATH]

Elizabeth suffering much still from headaches, Dr. Sandys was
consulted, and he recommended the plunge bath. This was at Marylebone,
at the then popular gardens. This was considered a hazardous exploit,
and she first wrote to ask her parents’ consent. Writing to Sarah, she
says--

 “If you was to see me souse into the cold bath, you would think I
 had not sense or feeling.... The Duchess went with me the first
 time, and was frightened out of her wits, but I behaved much to my
 honour. Mrs. Verney went to learn to go in of me. Mrs. Pendarves
 went with me to-day, and was as pale as a ghost with the fear of
 my being drowned, which you know is impossible. I go in every
 day and have found benefit already; but there are two things I
 dislike, viz. the pain of going overhead, and the expense of the
 bath. The Duke and Duchess are very good in lending me the coach
 every morning to Marrybone, which is two miles from here, but the
 bath was better than any at Charing Cross: the Duchess says if
 there is any bath, as she thinks there is in their neighbourhood at
 Bullstrode, she will send me to it, a tub not being near so good.”

The whole parish of Marylebone belonged to the Duchess of Portland.
There were nine springs of water there: _vide_ “Old and New London,”
vol. iv.

[Page heading: FAIRINGS]

April, 1740, occurs a letter to her sister Sarah, written whilst
staying with the duchess in London. Elizabeth says--

 “Lord Oxford went to Bath in the post chaise for a week, he brought
 us all fairings. Mine were a fan, and a snuff box of Egyptian
 pebbles set in Pinchbeck.[86] The Duchess a fan, and an enamel tag
 for her lace.”

    [86] Christopher Pinchbeck invented this sham gold. He died in 1732.

The next letter to her mother says--

 “I was at Mr. Zincke’s yesterday in the morning, where I am to
 sit for my picture. On Thursday we went out of town to Sir John
 Stanley’s[87] at North End. There we met Mrs. Pendarves. I was
 much pleased with my visit. Sir John at 80 years old has as much
 politeness, good nature and cheerfulness as I ever met; his
 behaviour has neither the formality of age, nor the pertness of
 youth.”

    [87] Sir John Stanley married Anne Granville, aunt to Mrs.
    Pendarves, who had been Maid-of-Honour to Queen Mary II.

[Page heading: “LONG” SIR THOMAS ROBINSON]

In March Lord Oxford gave a ball at Marylebone--

 “The Ball was very agreeable. I will give you the list of company
 as they danced;--the Duchess and Lord Foley,[88] the Duke and
 Mrs. Pendarves, Lord Dupplin and ‘Dash,’[89] Lord George[90] and
 ‘Fidget,’ Lord Howard and Miss Cesar, Mr. Granville[91] and Miss
 Tatton, Mr. Howard and another Miss Cesar. The partners were chosen
 by their fans, but a little supercherie in the case of one of our
 dancers appointed failed, so our worthy cousin Sir Tommy[92] was
 sent for, and he came, but when he had drawn Miss Cesar’s fan
 he would not dance with her, but Mr. Hay,[93] who as the more
 canonical diversion, chose cards, danced with the poor forsaken
 damsel. The Knight bore the roast with great fortitude, and to make
 amends promised his neglected Fair a ball at his house. I believe
 in his economy he saves a dinner when invited to supper, for he
 eat a forequarter of lamb, a chicken, with a plentiful portion of
 ham, potted beef and jellies innumerable, and made a prodigious
 breakfast of bread and butter and coffee, a little after two in
 the morning.... I sat for my picture[94] this morning to Zincke; I
 believe it will be very like. I am in Anne Boleyn’s dress. I desire
 you to send me up my worked facing and robing, my point, some
 lute-string, and the cambrick for my ruffles. I had the pleasure
 of hearing to-day that our dear Robert had succeeded in getting a
 ship. I am sorry he will go out with the first fleet. I tremble,
 too, for fear he should have any engagement with the Spaniards.
 Mrs. D’Ewes desires to recommend herself to you being of the party
 of loving sisters.”

    [88] Thomas, 2nd Baron Foley.

    [89] Miss Dashwood, “Delia.”

    [90] Lord George Bentinck, the duke’s brother.

    [91] Brother of Mrs. Pendarves.

    [92] “Long” Sir Thomas Robinson, of Rokeby.

    [93] The Rev. Robert Hay, son of the 7th Earl of Kinnoul; afterwards
    Archbishop of York.

    [94] See portrait in this book.

Mrs. D’Ewes, _née_ Anne Granville, was the beloved sister of Mrs.
Pendarves, recently married to Mr. John D’Ewes.... In the next letter
to her mother she describes what she calls a “new head,” given to her
by the duchess. “Last Tuesday I put on my New head; it is extremely
handsome, very broad, and the lace has more thin work in it than has
been made till this year.” To this head was added ruffles and a tucker
by the same donor. Quin was acting then in London. She writes to Sarah--

 “I have been to the play _As you Like it_. Quin outdid his usual
 outdoings. I never heard anything spoke with such command of
 voice and action as the ‘seven stages of man,’ from the rough bass
 of the good Justice, ‘whose round belly with good capon lined,’
 till he sunk to the childish treble; it was really prodigious, the
 alteration of the voice, he spoke the slippered pantaloon just like
 my Uncle Clark.[95] I saw the facetious Monsieur and Mademoiselle
 Fausan dance, but Quin had so possessed himself of my thoughts
 that I was not over-delighted with them, tho’ I think they dance
 very well for a character dance. Wednesday I went into the cold
 bath, and from thence the Duke and Duchess, Mr. Achard, Lord George
 Bentinck, Lady Throckmorton, Mrs. Collingwood, and Sir Robert
 Throckmorton[96] went to Mary-le-Bone gardens to breakfast; after
 that they all went with me to Zincke’s to sit for my picture, and
 we spent the evening at Vaux Hall. On Thursday we went, two coaches
 and six, to Kew, Richmond, and Petersham, Lord Harrington’s,[97]
 where I could turn Pastorella with great pleasure, such prospects,
 from the most charming place I ever saw, I was ready to call out,
 ‘O care Selve beate.’ I would tell you more of my meditations, but
 the bell for supper interrupts me.”

    [95] Her great-uncle on her mother’s side.

    [96] 4th Baronet and his second wife.

    [97] 1st Earl of Harrington.

[Page heading: LORD WALLINGFORD’S DEATH]

Lady Wallingford was attacked by smallpox at this time, but had it very
favourably. In a letter to Mrs. Robinson, Elizabeth says--

 “She never had three hundred all over her, and was at the heighth,
 I believe, in seven days. Her Lord dyed very suddenly of a quinsy
 before she had been downstairs, so she had not even the melancholy
 consolation of a last farewell; she laid up two pairs of stairs,
 and he below, so they told her he was removed, and died at
 Kensington. He has left everything to her.... Lord Wallingford
 certainly caught his death with attending her, a sad aggravation
 of the affliction; he died with the greatest courage imaginable.
 Sandys, who with several Physicians and Surgeons was called in,
 begged him to settle his affairs, upon which he made his will (that
 he had by him, being very deficient in points of Law), and took
 leave of his friends. There was no hopes from the first, for this
 convulsive Quinsy is always mortal.”

In another she says he died of “cramp in the throat,” which sounds more
likely. It has been stated that Lord Wallingford died in France, but
his death occurred at Whitehall.

The duke and family, including Elizabeth, left Whitehall in June for
Bullstrode.[98] In a letter of June 24 to Mr. Freind and his wife, she
says--

 “The rural beauties of the place would persuade me I was in the
 plains of Arcadia, but the magnificence of the building under whose
 gilded roof I dwell, has a pomp far beyond pastoral. We go to
 chapel twice a week, and have sermons on Sunday, for his Grace of
 Portland values the title of Christian above that of Duke, and the
 chaplain may preach against every vice in fashion without fear of
 offending either his Patron or Patroness.”

    [98] Bullstrode was originally in the Shobbington family before the
    Conquest. Judge Jefferies bought it, and built the house here
    mentioned in 1686. His son-in-law sold it to the Earl of Portland.
    In 1807 it was sold to the Duke of Somerset.

[Page heading: THE MENAGERIE]

In another letter--

 “We breakfast at 9, dine at 2, drink tea at 8, and sup at 10. In
 the morning we work or read. In the afternoon the same, walk from
 6 till tea-time, and then write till supper. I think since we
 came down our despatches in numbers, tho’ not in importance, have
 equalled those at the Secretary’s Office.... The Duchess and I have
 been walking in the woods to-night, and feeding the pheasants in
 the menagerie. The late Duke had Macaws, Parrots, and all sorts of
 foreign birds flying in one of the woods; he built a house and kept
 people to wait upon them; there are now some birds in the house,
 and one Macaw, but most were destroyed in the Duke’s minority.”

[Page heading: FRANKS]

[Page heading: LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU]

On July 22 occurs this interesting letter to her mother--

  “MADAM,

 “Much visiting has of late hindered my writing to you. My Lady
 Duchess does not care to spare me to write except when she is so
 employed too, and the time set apart for that is in the evening,
 and when we make visits at any distance, it is late before we
 return, and letters go from here between 10 and 11. When we first
 came down, we supped at 9, but we found so early an hour encroached
 too much upon our hours of writing, so now we sup at 10, at which
 time the Duke comes into the Duchess’s dressing-room,[99] where
 we write together, and franks our packets. On Saturday, we were
 at Windsor to visit the Miss Granvilles, daughters of the famous
 Lord Lansdowne;[100] they unhappily inherit neither the wit of
 their Father, nor the beauty of their Mother.[101]... The Duchess
 is very civil to them, and Miss Granville was her acquaintance in
 infancy, and it is very right in her to take notice of them now.
 Lord Weymouth[102] supports them, but how long he will be willing
 or able to do so, no one knows. On Sunday, I was at Mrs. Hare’s,
 widow to the late Bishop Hare,[103] and was much entertained there
 by Sir John Shadwell and his family, who are just come from abroad.
 Lady Shadwell[104] saw Lady Mary Wortley at Venice, where she now
 resides, and asked her what made her leave England; she told them
 the reason was, people were grown so stupid she could not endure
 their company, all England was infected with dullness; by-the-bye,
 what she means by insupportable dullness is her husband,[105] for
 it seems she never intends to come back while he lives. A husband
 may be but a dull creature to one of Lady Mary’s sprightly genius,
 but methinks even her vivacity might accommodate itself to living
 in the Kingdom with him; she is a woman of great family merit, she
 has banished her children,[106] abandoned her husband. I suppose
 as she cannot reach Constantinople, she will limit her ambition to
 an intrigue with the Pope or the Doge of Venice.... The Duke of
 Leeds’[107] wedding was very grand. The Duke of Newcastle’s[108]
 entertainment upon the occasion was 15 dishes in a course, four
 courses. The Duchess of Newcastle, sister to Lady Mary Godolphin,
 and Mr. Hay are gone down with the Duke and Duchess of Leeds. The
 Duchess had a diamond necklace from her Mother worth £10,000,
 she was very fine in cloaths and jewels. The old Duchess of
 Marlborough[109] is now mightily fond of her. Her Grace is at law
 with the Duke of Marlbro’; she talked two hours like the widow
 Blackacre in Westminster Hall, amongst things of value she was to
 surrender to the Duke[110] there was the late Duke’s fine sword,
 and George, ‘Oh,’ says she, ‘as for the George, he will sell it,
 but for the sword he won’t know what to do with that, so I believe
 he will lay it by, or may be if he can he will pawn it, he can make
 no other use of it, I am sure.’... Pray have you heard from the
 dear little boys?[111] I have always forgot their direction. I
 think it is Scorton, near Richmond?

  “Your most dutiful daughter,

[Page heading: THE REV. WILLIAM FREIND]

Mr. Freind, having written a letter to Elizabeth expressing a fear that
her head might be turned by the great company, and the splendid place
she was residing in, she replies--

 “I am neither condemning greatness, nor envying it, but gratefully
 and cheerfully enjoying what I am. I thank Providence for the
 blessings it has given me, without either despising or wishing
 for the gifts it has bestowed on others. I enjoy the present time
 without regretting the past, or wishing for that to come, but still
 as conducive to happiness, prefer to-day to yesterday or to-morrow.
 I keep content for the present, and hope for the future, and love
 this life without fearing another.”

This letter was sent to Witney, Oxon, the seat of the blanket
manufacture. The Rev. William Freind had become Rector there, since the
resignation of his father, the Rev. Dr. Robert Freind, in the previous
year. His mother was a Miss Jane de l’Angle, daughter of the Rev.
Samuel de l’Angle, once pastor of the reformed church at Charenton,
near Paris, who, on the persecution of Louis XIV., fled to England and
was made a Prebendary of Westminster. The Rev. William Freind built
the good stone rectory still existent at Witney. A medallion portrait
of him is over a door in the Hall. Mrs. Donnellan had been recommended
to drink the waters at Spa in the Ardennes, and, accompanied by her
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Cottington, set out, poor Mr. Cottington dying
soon after their arrival. Mrs. Donnellan wrote to Elizabeth on July 11
a long letter, out of which I copy the account of the water cure as
then practised--

 “We are all out by six in the morning in our chaises, and go three
 miles to the Geronsterre waters. We come home by nine, and take
 a cup of chocolate, dine between 12 and 1, go to the Assembly at
 4, where there are all countries, and all languages, half a dozen
 card tables, and no crowd; from the Assembly we take a walk in the
 Capucins garden; all are in before 8 to supper, and to bed at 10.”

[Page heading: PRINCESS MARY OF HESSE]

Princess Mary[112] of England had been married in May to the Prince of
Hesse.[113] The prince did not come to England, so her brother, the
Duke of Cumberland, acted proxy. The following account is of gifts
given to the princess’s suite who accompanied her to Hesse:--

 “The Duchess of Dorset[114] has had fine presents upon going over
 with the Princess of Hesse. The Prince presented her with a gold
 teapot, tea-kettle, and lamp, and Lady Caroline Sackville[115] with
 a set of Dresden china and a diamond solitaire. The Duchess had
 likewise a set of Dresden teacups, and a service of Dresden China,
 and the King gave her a gold snuffbox with a thousand pounds Bank
 bill in it.”

    [112] Princess Mary, daughter of George II.

    [113] Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse Cassel.

    [114] Wife of 1st Duke of Dorset, _née_ Elizabeth Colyear.

    [115] Daughter of the Duchess of Dorset, afterwards Countess of
    Dorchester.

In a letter to Sarah Robinson of August 11, mention is made of--

 “a mask at Cliefden, on Princess Augusta’s[116] birthday; ‘The
 Story of Alfred,’ wrote by Thomson[117] and Mallet,[118] Mr.
 Grenville commends it and says it will be published. I own I
 cannot give much credit to it, for I rather imagine he commends
 it as a patriot than a judge. I never knew anything of Thomson’s
 that seemed to be wrote, or could be read, without great labour of
 the brain.... Lord and Lady Oxford are to come here next Monday,
 (Bullstrode), and stay a month. Lord Dupplin has made a copy of
 verses upon my going into the bath, which we would impute to
 Sandys[119] to his great amazement. He says he does not know who
 wrote them, but thinks he is very sure he did not.”

    [116] Daughter of George II., born 1737.

    [119] A well-known lady’s doctor.

[Page heading: MONKEY ISLAND]

August 25, Elizabeth writes to her father--

 “The Duke and Duchess were so obliging as to carry me to see
 Windsor Castle last week. It is so delightful a place and so fine
 a palace, I am surprised his Majesty does not spend his summer
 there, I should think it as well as going to Hanover. The same day
 we were at Windsor, we went to see a little island[120] circled by
 the Thames, which the Duke of Marlborough[121] purchased and has
 beautified at the expense of £8000. There is too great an embarras
 of buildings upon it, the finest of which I think something
 resembling the Temple of Janus. He has a better title to build one
 to war than to fame, for he has got a commission, but renown I
 believe is what he will never gain. He sent out a few days ago for
 four-score workmen to improve a place he never proposes to live at,
 after the old Duchess dies. His Grandfather now saved a people, now
 saved a groat, but such a warrior and economist as this gentleman
 he will never save either.

 “Lady Andover[122] told me in a letter I received from her last
 post, that Mrs. Botham was grown very grave, and a great workwoman
 and an excellent housewife; if that is the case, Mr. Botham
 preaches to those of his household as well as those of his parish.”

    [120] Monkey Island.

    [121] Charles, 3rd Duke.

    [122] Second daughter of Heneage, Earl of Aylesford, wife of
    William, Lord Andover.

[Page heading: LYDIA BOTHAM]

[Page heading: COUNTESS OF OXFORD]

This is the first allusion to Lydia Botham, cousin of Elizabeth
Robinson; she, and her more illustrious sister Elizabeth, or Eliza
Lumley, afterwards wife of the Rev. Laurence Sterne, of “Shandean”
memory, were the children of the Rev. Robert Lumley, of the Lumley
Castle family, Rector of Bedale, Yorks, from 1721 to 1732; and of
Lydia, daughter of Anthony Light,[123] and widow in 1709 of her first
husband, Thomas Kirke, of Cockridge, near Leeds (a famous Virtuoso),
she married afterwards the Rev. Robert Lumley;[124] for the table
elucidating this pedigree the reader must turn to the end of the
introductory portion of this work. The Lumleys are said to have been
brought up in style, but little means had remained to them. Both
parents were dead; Lydia had recently married the Rev. John Botham,
Rector of Yoxall, Staffordshire. Elizabeth Lumley, her sister, was
residing alone in “Little Alice Lane,” under the shadow of York
Cathedral. In a folio-sheet letter to her sister Sarah, Elizabeth
explains that owing to the Countess of Oxford being at Bullstrode, she
had more time to herself, as the countess and she had spent alternate
mornings with the duchess. The countess was kind to Elizabeth, but she
was a rare admirer of etiquette. When she was with the duchess, she
actually wished to see all her letters, which was naturally annoying
to a married woman; she also expected them to be couched in the most
formal manner, as addressed _to a ducal person_! Hence, when Elizabeth
was away from the duchess, and Lady Oxford was with her, the letters
were often written under cover to the duchess’s two lady dressers,
so as to indulge in fewer formalities; also, as can be read in Mrs.
Delany’s Memoirs in letters from the duchess, nicknames were often set
up between the circle of friends, known only to themselves in case
of their being opened. This passage in the letter will point to the
formality of the circle when including Lady Oxford--

 “While our present Guests are here we are so overcharged with
 ceremony, we cannot move about, and as I am not (thanks to the
 humility of my station), of the Countess’ cabinet council, I have
 the morning to myself. To employ them to my edification, I have
 laid in a great store of Italian, which I cannot read with the
 Duchess as she has forgotten it so much. I have laid aside the
 Arcadia[125] till Mrs. Pendarves comes, who is fond of it, and the
 Duchess and I have agreed that she shall read it to us.... I beg
 you will send me the receipt for York Curds, and also for Pancakes,
 called ‘A quire of paper.’”

    [123] Of Durham; his grandmother, wife of Gilbert Kirke, was one of
    the coheiresses of Francis Layton of Rawdon.

    [124] As stated in former pages, her mother, Mrs. Light, remarried
    for second husband, Thomas Robinson, father by her of
    Matthew Robinson.

    [125] “The Arcadia,” written by Sir Philip Sidney.

On August 21, in a letter to Mrs. Donnellan at Spa, occurs the passage--

 “Our friend Penny is under great anxiety for the change her sister
 is going to make. I do not wonder at her fears; I believe both
 experience, and observation, have taught her the state she is
 going into is in the general, less happy than that she has left.
 ‘Pip’ has a good prospect, for they say the gentleman[126] has
 good sense, good nature, and great sobriety; these are very good
 things, and indeed what a stock of virtues and qualifications ought
 to be laid in to last out the journey of life, where so much too
 lies through the rugged ways of adversity, all will hardly serve to
 lengthen love and patience to the end.”

    [126] John D’Ewes, of Wellesbourne, Co. Warwick.

The lady to be married was Anne Granville, whose nickname was “Pip”;
she was about to be married to Mr. John D’Ewes. “Pen” was Mrs.
Pendarves’ nickname, afterwards Mrs. Delany, and those who have read
her memoirs will remember how unhappy was her _first_ experience of
married life. Much mention is made in this letter of an apron Elizabeth
is working for the duchess; she begs for patterns of flowers from her
father’s pencil, and Mr. Hateley, an artist friend. Embroidered aprons
were then the rage, but only for demi-toilette; the beautiful Duchess
of Queensberry,[127] going to Court in an apron about this time, was
forbidden to attend. The aprons were of all colours as well as white,
and the duchess, fearing a light ground would soon soil, bade Elizabeth
work hers on a black ground. Sarah Robinson at the same time was
working her sister one.

    [127] Catherine Hyde, Duchess of Queensberry. Prior’s “Kitty,
    beautiful and young;” wife of 3rd Duke.

[Page heading: EARL OF OXFORD]

The following passage is indicative of the times:--

 “Lord Oxford drinks hard at the chaplain sometimes, but whether a
 churchman’s conscience lyes deep, or a bumper to Church and King
 agrees with an orthodox stomach, I don’t know, but he seems less
 confounded with a bottle of claret than he is with his text, and
 shows the bottom of it too, which he cannot do with the other.”

Mr. Freind having written a letter in which he rallies Elizabeth about
not choosing one of her many admirers, she replies--

 “I have lately studied my own foibles, and I have found out I
 should make a very silly wife, and an extremely foolish Mother,
 and so have as far resolved as is consistent with deference to
 reason and advice, never to trouble any man, or spoil any children.
 I already love too many people in this world to enjoy a perfect
 tranquility, and I don’t care to have any more strings to pull my
 heart; it is very tender, and a small matter hurts it. I have been
 lately a little out of spirits about my incomparable Duchess; she
 has been a good deal out of order, but by bleeding and care, she is
 much better, I wish I could say well.”

[Page heading: ADMIRAL VERNON]

Mention of Admiral Vernon[128] is made in a letter of September 12 to
Mr. Freind after the victory of Portobello, which had been taken by him
in 1739; he had bombarded Carthagena--

 “I hope the glorious Vernon will do some great exploit by himself.
 All the ladies in Suffolk give place to Mrs. Vernon, even those of
 the highest rank. I wish the Admiral may be made a peer when he
 returns, Baron Something and Viscount Portobello will sound very
 well.”

    [128] Admiral Vernon, born 1684, died 1757.

[Page heading: CHARLEMAGNE]

Mrs. Donnellan returned from Spa early in September, in company of
Mrs. Anne Pitt, a sister of Mr. William Pitt, afterwards Lord Chatham.
Portions of her letter I copy--

 “We had a very pleasant journey together, and find ’tis possible
 to travel comfortably without that lordly person--_Man!_ I have
 mentioned being at Aix-la-Chapelle, which is a bad day’s journey
 from Spa. I went with Mrs. Hoare, and we chose to go at the time
 Charlemagne makes his procession round the town, which is an annual
 ceremony, and the most solemn and ridiculous I have seen. He built
 the town, and made it an imperial city, and this procession is in
 memory of him. He is represented by a pasteboard figure, 12 feet
 high (for they will have him a giant), he has on his head a very
 fine curled and powdered full-bottomed periwig, an Imperial crown
 on that; downwards, he has a yellow damask night-gown, which hides
 those who carry him. He walks round the city attended by all the
 Orders in their different habits (which is a pretty sight),--the
 magistracy, and the Host carried under a canopy. They stopped
 before the Town House where we were, and said Mass at an altar
 raised on purpose, then they adored the Host, and Charlemagne
 stooped and goggled his eyes, which are pulled by wires, and so the
 ceremony ended. We landed at Deal on Sunday night, in a storm of
 thunder, lightning and wind, wet to the skin. I have bought some
 Spa necklaces. I have a blue one for you, and a green one for the
 Duchess.

 “My folks are quite taken up with fitting their[129] house in Bond
 Street, which they design getting into at Michaelmas. I have a
 cheerful dressing room in it, which I dedicate to a few friends,
 none other shall come into it, and it luckily only holds a few
 seats; I will reserve one for you.”

    [129] Her mother, then the Hon. Mrs. Philip Perceval, and her second
    husband.

[Page heading: THE REV. DR. YOUNG]

On September 23, in a letter of Elizabeth to her sister, we first
hear of Dr. Young, the author of “Night Thoughts.” At this time this
celebrated poem was not written, but various other poems, satires, and
tragedies had made him famous. Edward Young, LL.D., was born in 1684,
educated at Winchester, New College, and Corpus Christi, Oxford; in
1730 was Rector of Welwyn, Herts; in 1731 he married Lady Betty Lee,
widow of Colonel Lee, and daughter of the Earl of Lichfield. The Duke
of Wharton was his literary patron.

 “Dr. Young is coming soon. We wish for his coming, for I hear he
 is agreeable, and, indeed, his private character is excellent. He
 sends his compliments to me when he writes to the Duchess, and says
 he is perfectly acquainted with me, and all that is the vision of
 a Poet, for I never saw him in my life, but he is so kind as to
 commend me and all my works in all places.”

In the next letter (October 8) she says--

  “MY DEAR SALLY,

 “The sons of Apollo haunt this place much; the tuneful
 Green[130] is gone, but the poetical Dr. Young is with us. I
 am much entertained with him, he is a very sensible man, has a
 lively imagination, and strikes out very pretty things in his
 conversation, tho’ he has satyrized the worst of our sex, he
 honours the best of them extremely, and seems delighted with those
 who act and think reasonably. I think he has written a Satire
 against that composition of oddity, affectation, and folly which is
 called ‘a pretty sort of a woman,’--if anyone has a mind to put on
 that character they need only pervert their sense, distort their
 faces, disjoint their limbs, mince their phrases, and lisp their
 words, and the thing is done, grimaces, trite sentences, affected
 civility, forced gaiety, and an imitation of good nature completes
 the character.... That sentences, systems and definitions should
 give way to Cribbage, but two Duchesses command my presence! The
 Duchess of Kent[131] came here yesterday; she is a very sensible
 polite woman, and she wants one to play Cribbage, so my dear, dear
 sister, Adieu!

  “E. R.”

    [130] Dr. Green, a celebrated musician.

    [131] The second wife of Henry (Grey), 1st Duke of Kent, _née_
    Sophia Bentinck, great-aunt of the Duke of Portland of these pages.

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF KENT]

In a letter to Mrs. Robinson--

 “The Duchess of Kent is very agreeable, has good sense and
 politeness, and those who know her well say many valuable
 qualities. I look upon my Duchess as the Arch-Duchess, before whom
 all lesser stars hide their diminished heads; as for Dr. Young, he
 is a very sensible man, and an entertaining companion, and starts
 new subjects of conversation, and there is nothing so much wanted
 in the country as the art of making the same people chase new
 topics without change of persons. The Duchess and Dr. Young design
 to leave us to-morrow.... Dr. Sandys has given Deb quicksilver,
 which has been of great service to her, and it appears that she had
 worms.”

“Deb” was Elizabeth’s lady’s maid. The Pharmacopeia was then of such an
extraordinary kind, that from time to time I shall mention the remedies
used for various complaints; why more people were not killed by some of
the nostrums is marvellous.

Elizabeth writes to Sarah on November 1, telling her she is reading the
“Decameron” of Boccaccio. The duchess was also renewing her Italian
knowledge. They were reading aloud Dr. Samuel Clarke’s sermons, and she
says--

 “Hay[132] is an auditor, as he cannot read himself; Mr. Achard is
 a translator of pronunciation so that one would take his English
 to be French when he reads aloud, then as for the Duke, he hunts
 thrice a week, and has business, so that our invalid is glad of a
 female lecturer.”

    [132] The Hon. John Hay, son of 7th Earl of Kinnoul, a relation of
    the duchess, then a great invalid.

Mr. Achard, a Frenchman mentioned previously, had been the duke’s
tutor, and was now his secretary.

From the letters, he appears to have been very tall; he was frequently
called “Brother Bonaventura,” and as his humour was variable, at times
“Monsieur du _Poivre_,” at others “Monsieur du _Miel_!”

[Page heading: DR. GREY]

The next letter to her father thanks him for a design he had made for
an apron for the duchess, with which she was delighted, and--

 “if the work could be as elegant as the drawing, would be the
 most finished apron for the most finished Duchess. Lord Oxford
 and George Vertue[133] arrived here last night after a ramble
 which the best geographer could hardly describe; they have been
 haunting church-yards, and reading the history of mankind upon the
 gravestones. Dr. Grey[134] is employed in a work which to make its
 appearance in public you would not easily guess at. I believe ’tis
 no perplexity upon Mysteries, no refutation of the doctrine of
 Transubstantiation, no explanation of the Catechism, but a thing
 for which his serious qualifications do not seem very fit. He is
 writing upon Hudibras!”

    [133] George Vertue, eminent engraver, archæologist, and author;
    born 1684, died 1756.

    [134] Rev. Dr. Zachary Grey, author, died 1766.




CHAPTER III.

IN LONDON, KENT, AND AT BULLSTRODE, 1741–42. BEGINNING OF
CORRESPONDENCE WITH MRS. DELANY.


The last letter of the year 1740 is written to Mr. Freind on December
29--

 “Next Sunday I quit the peaceful groves and hospitable roof of
 Bullstrode for the noisy turbulent city; my books and serious
 reflections are to be laid aside for the looking-glass and curling
 irons, and from that time I am no more a Pastorella, but propose to
 be as idle, as vain, and as impertinent, as any one; if you will
 come to town Mrs. Freind and you will find me, however, as like
 myself as to be your _sincere friend_.”

[Year: 1741]

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF QUEENSBERRY]

February 5, Elizabeth writes to her sister--

  “DEAR MADAM SALLY,

 “I went to Lady North’s[135] last night, to see all the fine
 cloaths that were made for the Birthday. Lady Scarborough[136]
 was richly dressed, the Duchess of Bedford[137] was pretty fine,
 Mrs. Spencer had a white velvet which is the ugliest thing in the
 world, but the Duchess of Queensberry[138] was such as should be
 shown at Courts and feasts, and high solemnities, where most may
 wonder at the workmanship; her cloaths were embroidered upon white
 satin; Vine leaves, Convolvulus and Rosebuds shaded after Nature;
 but she in herself was so far beyond the masterpiece of art, that
 one could hardly look at her cloaths; allowing for her age I never
 saw so beautiful a creature. Miss Pitt[139] had a fine trimming
 and looked very pretty, but as for the Roses, they do not bloom
 in January, for she is as pale as a ghost. Lady Mary Tufton[140]
 had a pretty suit of embroidery. The men were not at all fine.
 Mr. Lyttelton’s[141] cloaths were ugly, according to Polonius’
 instructions, ‘Rich not gaudy, fine but not exprest in fancy.’ I
 did not see any new fashions, as to the wearing stays, I think they
 are as usual. I do not know what will become of your fine shape,
 for there is a fashionable make that is very strange. I believe
 they look in London as they did in Rome after the Rape of the
 Sabines.

  “I am, my dearest, your most affectionate
  “E. ROBINSON.”

    [135] Second wife of 7th Baron North, afterwards 1st Earl of
    Guilford.

    [136] Wife of 3rd Earl Scarborough.

    [137] Second wife of the 4th Duke.

    [138] Wife of 3rd Duke, “Kitty ever fair.”

    [139] A sister of Lord Chatham, either Mary or Anne.

    [140] Daughter of 7th Earl of Thanet.

    [141] George, 1st Lord Lyttelton, afterwards her intimate friend.

February 25, Sarah writes--

 “I should be obliged to you if you would in your next letter send
 me word what sized hoops moderate people who are neither over
 lavish nor covetous of whalebone, wear; because I intend to write
 to my Hoop maker to have one ready for me against I come to town,
 and I don’t care to leave the size of it to her discretion. I hope
 our hoops will not increase much more, for we are already almost as
 unreasonable as Queen Dido,[142] and don’t encircle much less with
 our whalebone, than she did with her bull’s hide.”

    [142] Queen Dido of Tyre bought of the Africans as much land as a
    bull’s hide would cover, and by cutting it into strips encircled a
    large portion.

[Page heading: HAIRDRESSING]

A light is thrown on hairdressing of the period in the following letter
to Sarah:--

  “DEAR SISTER,

 “I have been walking in the Park this morning, and returned only
 time enough to dress, so while Deb is tiffing and tiffing till my
 hair is so pure and so crisp, I am writing a line to you to the
 great vexation of Mrs. Mincing, who is afraid I should be the worst
 dressed for it. I don’t wonder an ‘Abigail’ that is kept only as
 a Minister of the toilette should look upon dressing as the great
 concern of life, but that other people should make such a point of
 it I marvel greatly. Some women by endeavouring to be as handsome
 as they can are not so charming as they might be. I never thought a
 head agreeably dressed that had not a hair awry; such punctuality
 may become a tyre woman, but cannot a belle, but however, it
 becomes everybody to be dressed for dinner, which will not be
 the case if I do not conclude. I am to go to the ‘Penseroso and
 Allegro’ to-night. The music of the ‘Penseroso’ some say is best,
 ‘but Mirth with thee I choose to live.’ Adieu.”

One can, indeed, pity the unfortunate Abigail with “Fidget” writing
whilst she had her hair dressed! Once after a visit to Bullstrode, the
duchess says she had found a glass-stand left behind by Elizabeth,
should she send it? And the reply was that the stand was used for her
to rest her chin on whilst her maid dressed her hair. The ridiculously
high coiffure of the day must have taken a long time to erect.

[Page heading: “THE PEAS”]

No letter can I find till April 10, when the Rev. William Freind writes
from Bath, where he and his wife were staying, to inquire what had
become of his cousins. Sarah Robinson’s[143] pet-name was “Pea,” as she
was pronounced to resemble Elizabeth as much as one pea does another.

  “Bath, April 10, 1741.

 “It being now near two months since I have received any
 intelligence of either of my correspondents, I must needs enclose
 a letter to Pea, Senior, to enquire after her whether she be still
 with the Duke to whom I direct the cover, or with the rest of the
 Peas in her own Podd in Kent.

 “I expected the beginning of March to hear you had quitted her
 grace to join hearts and hands once more with dearly beloved Pea.
 But Lady Berkshire whom I saw some days ago, tells me the Duchess
 is in a very bad state of health, which I suppose will make you
 both very unwilling to part with each other. I have rather fancied
 therefore some disappointment has happened, and that your friend’s
 illness may have taken up your time and thoughts too much to let us
 hear what is become of you, for if both sisters had been together
 in town, surely both would not have grudged us the pleasure of
 hearing you were well and happy.... Even I, surrounded with a
 set of noisy politicians on one side, and backgammon players on
 t’other, can still make shift to write a line to my dear friend,
 and ask only how she does, and where she is, and to assure her that
 I and my Pea are

  “Her and Her Peas,
  “Most truly affectionate
  friends and humble servants,
  “W. and G. F.”[144]

    [143] Sarah was born on September 21, 1723, so was three years
    younger than Elizabeth.

    [144] William and Grace his wife.

[Page heading: HAYTON FARM]

The reason of the unaccustomed silence was this--Sarah was suddenly
attacked by smallpox, a disease peculiarly dreaded by Elizabeth. Mrs.
Robinson quickly despatched her to Hayton Farm, a family property
leased to a yeoman farmer of the name of Smith.

April 8 occurs a letter to the duchess--

 “I cannot lose the opportunity which just offers me to send a
 letter to the post, though I troubled your Grace but yesterday. My
 sister continues as well as it is possible to be, and has found out
 her disorder with which she is perfectly content, and sends me very
 merry messages upon it: they are of the seven day sort, so will
 turn on Sunday, and on Monday when it is over, I shall possess my
 soul in quietness. I am afraid this hurry of spirits and fatigue,
 will not prove of service to my Mamma; and if the dire Hyp does
 haunt a solitary chimney corner, sure it will visit my Pappa now
 it is sure to find him at home and alone. For my part, I am in the
 case of poor David, my friends and kinsfolk stand afar off; and
 when I am to return home I don’t know. That the distemper may not
 continue, my Pappa has sent away half a dozen servants who have
 not had it, and says he hopes to have me back again very soon;
 but indeed I hope to prevail upon him to try how the air of Mount
 Morris agrees with his servants, before I return. I live here very
 easy, and I have got books and all the necessaries and comforts,
 though not the pomps and pleasures of life. The family are civil
 and sensible people. As for the Master of the house, he is indeed,
 to a tittle, Spenser’s meagre personage called Care: his chief
 accomplishment as to behaviour is silence. I never see him but
 at dinner and supper, and then he eats his pudding and holds his
 tongue. I believe his learning amounts to knowing that four pennies
 make a groat, and the sooner that groat is a sixpence he thinks
 the better. To give your grace a notion of the sort of persons who
 compose the Drama:--They are above Farmers considerably, have been
 possessed in the family, for aught I know, since the Conqueror of
 above £400 a year, they have a good old house, neatly furnished,
 but there is nothing of modern structure to be seen in it.

 “I am now sitting in an old crimson velvet elbow chair, I should
 imagine to be elder brother to that which is shown in Westminster
 Abbey as Edward the Confessor’s. There are long tables in the room
 that have more feet than the caterpillar you immured at Bullstrode.
 Why so many legs are needful to stand _still_, I cannot imagine,
 when I can fidget on two. There is a good chest of drawers in the
 figure of a Cathedral, and a looking glass which Rosamond or Jane
 Shore may have dressed their heads in. Not to forget the clock,
 who has indeed been a time server; it has struck the blessed
 minutes of the Reformation, Restoration, Abdication, Revolution,
 and Accession, and by its relation to time seems to have some to
 Eternity. It is like its old Master, only good to point the hour
 to industry; ... it calls his servant to yoke the oxen, get ready
 the plough, wakes the dairy maid to milk and churn, the daughters
 hear in it the paternal voice chiding the waste of hours, and rise
 obedient to its early call; even me it governs, sends me to bed
 at ten, and makes me rise, oh barbarous! at eight.... The mother
 of the family, a venerable matron of grave deportment, who was
 well educated, and moves in the form of antique ceremonies, but is
 really a sensible woman! The daughters are good housewifes, and I
 like some qualities in them, which I understand better than their
 economy. I only wish they could sleep in their beds in the morning,
 and wake in a chair in the evening!” ...

[Page heading: A COUNTRY SQUIRE]

The next letter to Mrs. Donnellan, whom Elizabeth rebukes for her
silence, is dated April 10. In this she says--

 “Before this time you must have been informed by the Duchess or
 Mrs. Pendarves of my distress, and also my flight from the maternal
 mansion to the house in the neighbourhood. I am at present very
 happy as my sister is out of all danger, and I rejoice in thinking
 she will have one enemy of life and health the less. So much for
 the state of my mind; the situation of my person is not so gay and
 cheerful. My best friends among the living are a Colony of rooks
 who have settled themselves in a grove by my window. They wake
 me early in the morning.... I have not yet discovered the form
 of their government, but I imagine it is democratical.... If I
 continue here long I shall grow a good naturalist. I have applied
 myself to nursing chickens, and have been forming the manners of a
 young calf, but I find it a very dull scholar. I intend to gather
 some cowslips for Mrs. Perceval[145] as soon as they appear; pray
 let me know if they should be prepared in any particular manner....

 “There are some squires here who would make excellent Polyphemus’s;
 one of them drank tea here yesterday, and complimented me with all
 the force of rural gallantry, but for some fault in the flattery or
 the flatterer, I liked neither him nor myself any better for all
 the fine things he said. After he was gone I did but relieve my
 spleen with some laughter on the subject, when I was told by the
 matron of the family, he would be a good match for a woman with
 twenty thousand pounds, and indeed could one lend out one’s liking
 upon land security, I think one might very well settle it upon him.
 To laugh at a poor man is barbarous. He is a great friend of the
 family I am with, and I fear will come often; and in spite of his
 respectable manors and fee simple, and ancient mansion, both great
 and good, I shall not be able to give a serious attention to his
 discourse.

 “I wish you could see my habitation, a right reverend and venerable
 one it is; the staircase that leads to my chamber is hung with the
 funeral escutcheons of my grandfathers, grandmothers, Aunts and
 Uncles, that I seem to be entering the burying vault of the family
 to sleep with my Fathers. It is a comfort, no doubt, to think one’s
 ancestors have had Christian burial, but of what use are these
 tawdry escutcheons? Sure no passion of the mind, no situation of
 the human creature is without vanity, if the mourner can adorn with
 pomp, and the breathless carcase be dressed in it.

 “... address to me at Mr. Smith’s, Hayton, near Hythe.”

    [145] Mrs. Donnellan’s mother.

[Page heading: HANDEL]

On April 9 the Duchess of Portland lay in of a daughter, Frances, who
died in 1743. Mrs. Donnellan writes on April 11 to give a good report
of the duchess’s health, and in this letter she says--

 “I long to hear from you, I want to know who you have to entertain,
 and keep up the spirits your sister’s safety must give you. I hope
 Mr. Robinson,[146] your brother, is in banishment with you, for you
 will want such a companion to sweeten a long absence from all your
 other friends. I heartily wish you were in any place where I could
 come to you.... The only show we have had since you left us was for
 Handel, his last night, all the fashionable people were there.”

    [146] Matthew, her eldest brother.

[Page heading: DR. CONYERS MIDDLETON]

Mrs. Donnellan again writes on April 15--

 “I like your situation extremely, but I should wish you one
 rational companion, for I do not think you were made for calves or
 poultry, or greater brutes in the shape of country squires. What is
 come of Pan? He used to find out a pretty female in her retirement,
 but as he has been sometimes a little dangerous, I think I had
 rather recommend you to the conversation of the wood nymphs. I have
 often wished to be acquainted with them, I fancy they are very
 innocent, and free from vanity and affectation, a little ignorant,
 and indeed in the fashions and amusements of London, as dress,
 cards, old china, Japan, shells, etc., but they may have notions of
 friendship and honour, and such antiquated things.

 “I have read no further than Cicero’s[147] consulship. By what I
 have read of Atticus in other authors particularly the Abbé St.
 Real,[148] who has given his character, and translated Cicero’s
 letters to him, I had not so high an opinion of him as I find
 Doctor Middleton has given you. I met yesterday, at Pen’s, the
 Bishop of Oxford,[149] Mrs. Secker and Miss Talbot,[150] and they
 seemed to think Dr. Middleton was not so much the historian as the
 Panegyrist of Cicero, indeed one observation I have already made
 myself, I think him too like a modern Lawyer who pleads all causes
 good or bad that gets him interest which was money to them; but
 when I have read the whole I will read St. Real again, and then I
 will tell you more of my mind. I long till you read Horace, and
 think he would be particularly proper in your present retirement,
 he seems to know how to amuse himself in such a scene better than
 any one I ever met with, at the same time that he was the delight
 of the politest court[151] that ever was. I really think you have
 much of the genius of distinguishing right from wrong, and not
 being led away by the false glosses of the world, and want to know
 whether you find that conformity.

 “I told you in my last I wished to spend some time with you in your
 banishment. I am so sincere in it, that if you were in a place
 where they are not above being paid for my lodging and board, I
 would come to you for one fortnight before you go home....

 “My Mother desires her compliments to you, and many thanks for
 remembering the cowslips. The manner of saving them is this only,
 pulling them out of the Pod, and letting them dry in a north
 window, and when they are dry, to put them up in a paper bag.

 “I have been this morning to St. Paul’s to hear Handel’s Te Deum.”

The cowslips Mrs. Perceval asked for were doubtless intended for making
that delicious but now seldom met with cowslip wine. Few people are
aware that a claret glass of cowslip wine before going to bed is an
innocent and generally successful soporific.


_To Mrs. Donnellan._

  “Hayton, April 20, 1741.

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “I had the pleasure of your letter yesterday, it made me very
 happy. If my friends at a distance did not keep my affections
 awake, I should be lulled into a state of insensibility, divided
 as I am from all I love.... What’s Cicero to me or I to Cicero?
 as Hamlet would say; and for myself, though this same little,
 insignificant self be very dear unto me, yet I have not used to
 make it my sole object of love and delight....

 “I want just such a companion as you would be, and how happy would
 your kind compliance with that wish make me, if the good old folk
 here would accommodate you; but they are so fearful of strangers,
 I know it impossible to persuade them to it. They are not very
 fine people; they have a little estate, and help it out with a
 little farming: are very busy and careful, and the old man’s
 cautionness has dwindled into penuriousness, so that he eats in
 fear of waste and riot, sleeps with the dread of thieves, denies
 himself everything for fear of wanting anything, riches give him no
 plenty, increase no joy, prosperity no ease: he has the curse of
 covetousness to want the property of his neighbours, while he dare
 not touch his own: the Harpy Avarice drives him from his own meat,
 the sum of his wisdom and his gains will be by living poor, to die
 rich....

 “The reason for which you wish I would read Horace does me great
 honour.... Upon your recommendation I had read it before, but
 depending on my brother’s having it, I did not bring it with me,
 and I find he has not got it. I will desire my brothers[152] to
 bring it down with them the next vacation.... As for some of our
 squires they read nothing but parish law, and books of Husbandry,
 or perhaps for their particular entertainment, ‘Quarle’s Emblems,’
 ‘The Pilgrim’s Progress,’ ‘Æsop’s Fables,’ and to furnish them with
 a little ready wit, ‘Joe Miller’s Jests.’”[153]

    [152] Matthew and Morris were at Cambridge.

    [153] Joe Miller, born 1684, died 1738; comedian. His “Book of
    Jests” was published in 1739.

[Page heading: THE REV. LAURENCE STERNE]

Matthew Robinson had gone to Bath to drink the waters, and on April 19
he writes to Elizabeth from “Colibee’s” in Hall Street, Bath--

  “DEAR SISTER,

 “The order of our Posts at Bath is very strange, the post comes
 in three times a week, twice of which you may answer your letters
 the same day you receive them, but the third not till three days
 afterwards. Last Thursday brought me two letters together from you,
 in which you informed me that my sister was past the heighth.... I
 hope next post will tell me that Sally is out of all danger.

 “Harry Goddard is here, and informs me that our cousin Betty Lumley
 is married to a Parson[154] who once delighted in debauchery, who
 is possessed of about £100 a year in preferment, and has a good
 prospect of more. What hopes our relation may have of settling
 the affections of a light and fickle man I know not, but I
 imagine she will set about it not by means of the beauty but of
 the arm of flesh. In other respects I see no fault in the match;
 no woman ought to venture upon the state of Old Maiden without a
 consciousness of an inexhaustible fund of good nature.”

The letter is signed “M. R. M.,” for Matthew Robinson Morris; as by
his uncle Morris Drake Morris’ will, Matthew was to succeed to his
mother’s[155] estate of Mount Morris, Kent, sometimes called Monk’s
Horton, etc., left her by her brother, he assumed the name of Morris
for some years, but returned to his family patronymic, Robinson,
_before_ becoming 2nd Baron Rokeby in 1794.

    [154] The Rev. Laurence Sterne, married to Elizabeth Lumley, March
    30, 1741, in York Cathedral, by license, by the then Dean.

    [155] Mrs. M. Robinson, his mother, inherited Coveney, Cambs, from
    her father, and the Kentish property as heiress of her mother,
    Sarah, daughter and heiress of Thomas Morris.

[Page heading: MRS. STERNE]

On the subject of the Sterne marriage, in a note to Sarah from
Elizabeth we see further--

  “DEAR MADAM SALLY,

 “I am glad to hear you are well, and that your eyes are brilliant,
 but pray don’t use them too soon, for you will have reason to
 repent it. I never saw a more comical letter than my sweet
 cousin’s,[156] with her heart and head full of matrimony, pray do
 matrimonial thoughts come upon _your recovery_? for she seems to
 think it a symptom.”

Then after many cautions to her sister as to her health, and
thankfulness at her being out of danger, she adds--

 “Matt mentions Mrs. Sterne’s match, of which he had an account from
 Harry Goddard, who is at Bath. Mr. Sterne has a hundred a year
 living, with a good prospect of better preferment. He was a great
 rake, but being japanned and married, has varnished his character.
 I do not comprehend what my cousin means by their little desires,
 if she had said little stomachs, it had been some help to their
 economy, but when people have not enough for the necessaries of
 life, what avails it that they can do without the superfluities and
 pomps of it? Does she mean that she won’t keep a coach and six, and
 four footmen? What a wonderful occupation she made of courtship
 that it left her no leisure nor inclination to think of any thing
 else. I wish they may live well together.”

    [156] Elizabeth Lumley had been very ill just before her engagement
    to Laurence Sterne: _vide_ his life by Traill.

[Page heading: “TRISTRAM”]

At this time Sterne was Vicar of Sutton-on-the-Forest,[157] some eight
miles from York, and his uncle, Jacob Sterne, gave him a prebendal
stall in York Cathedral about the same time. For two years he had
courted Elizabeth Lumley. She was much in love with him, but from
smallness of means on either side, deemed marriage imprudent. She,
however, had a desperate illness, and informed Sterne she had made
him her heir. His gratitude for this, and affection, recalled her to
life and matrimony. For details of this I must refer the reader to the
various lives written of “Tristram,” as his nickname was to be later in
the Robinson family.

    [157] His great-grandfather, Richard Sterne, had been Archbishop of
    York, and a friend of Laud’s.

From Hayton Elizabeth writes to Mr. Freind at Bath, to scold him for
not writing to her and her sister. In this she says--

 “My sister is well again, and once more I possess my soul with
 tranquillity. I believe you will guess I suffered great and
 terrible anxiety when I was forced to leave her to a dreadful
 distemper, whose terrors received great additions from my
 particular fears of it, and tenderness to her. The want of sleep,
 at first, a little damaged my constitution, I had a slight fever
 with disorder for a week, which I believe was chiefly occasioned by
 it. I did not mention it to my brother, for fear it should make him
 uneasy, but I am now perfectly well, and from the reflection of my
 sister’s good fortune, happy too, though great is the change you
 will see, from London and lolling on the velvet sofa of a duchess,
 to humbly sitting on a 3-legged cricket[158] in the country.”

    [158] A three-legged stool.

[Page heading: CURE FOR LOVE]

At the end of the letter of an admirer of her’s she says--

 “Our friend B----[159] increases in chin and misery, he came to
 breakfast with my Papa one morning, and complained of the Hyp,
 for which my good parent advised him to take assafœtida, the
 prescription was admirable, he might as well have sent him to the
 Tinker’s to have mended the hole in his heart. Oh! cruel fate that
 made no cure for love, thought my friend, and sighed bitterly:
 really I could not help laughing at the precious balm my Pappa was
 for applying to the wound. It would have ruined a happy lover with
 me.”

    [159] Mr. Brockman, of Beachborough.


_Letter from the Duke of Portland._

  “Whitehall, April 25, 1741.

  “MADAM,

 Since ye frivolous letters j trouble you with are ranked as
 favours you receive, j’am sure no excuse can be made for any
 neglect towards you, and it would, nay it does, make me wish ye
 post went out every day, yt j might have it in my power to confer
 my favours, such as they are, upon you: j’am not sure if vanity,
 as well as ye desire j have of doing all yt lays in my power to
 oblige you, does not have a share in this wish about ye post, for
 really j have reason to be proud yt a Lady of so many perfections
 as Miss Robinson, (j can’t name them singly for j should never
 have done), can sett any value upon my poor insignificant letters,
 tho’ your approving them might puff up any body’s vanity, yett j
 have humility enough to think that j owe all the favours you are
 pleased to show me, to ye subject j write about; it is a subject
 yt you will be no more tired to hear off than j to write off: then
 j am sure your next question will be, Pray my lord to ye subject:
 well then in complyance to your commands j am to inform you yt
 ye Duchess continues as well as can be, and ye Babe too. My wife
 desires me to tell you yt your letter revived her exceedingly, yt
 she had waited with great impatience for it, and yt she hopes to
 hear often from you. She, as well as myself, rejoice at your
 sister’s recovery, and desire our compliments to her. You may say
 everything yt is kind to yourself from my wife, and tho’ j am sure
 you have a very good genius in turning things as you like, you will
 hardly outdo her sentiments concerning you. Your being got rid of
 your feaver gave us great joy, for we began to be uneasy about
 Fidgett; nobody can see her without admiration, and when one hears
 her open her lips one is struck dumb; if one was to go on with
 everything when one receives a letter from you, one’s fingers would
 become numbed, and unable to answer, was it not for the desire of
 receiving more letters, makes one’s fingers to write to engage
 you to answer. In reading your letter j can’t help acquainting
 you yt there would be great strifes to be a Chaunticleer to be
 ye real possessor of such a Dame Partlett as you, whether of ye
 favourite little Bantam kind, or of the ruffled friesland kind; j
 should think the first more adapted to you for its gentility and
 rarity and cleanliness, all qualifications, which, tho’ j am no
 chanticleer j can sing off in your behalf. Nay j will do it. It is
 time for me to finish my letter to you tho’ j do not conclude my
 letter with such a pompous ‘humble servant’ as you do, j hope you
 are thoroughly persuaded that j am not less,

  “Madam,
  “Your most obedient, humble servant,
  “PORTLAND.”

[Illustration:

The letter concludes with a long postscript; the duke had put the
letter into his pocket to give the porter himself, not wishing, he
says, to trust “Mr. Puff” with it, and forgot it for some days. Despite
of all letters being sealed, they were constantly tampered with,
adroit incisions under the seals could be made, and refastened without
spoiling the impression above, and many letters were lost entirely.

[Page heading: MATTHEW ROBINSON]

[Page heading: A BROTHER’S ADMIRATION]

On April 27 occurs a most brotherly letter from Matthew from Bath. It
is too long to place here in full, but so beautiful are his words to
his sister, showing his love and admiration for her, that I give a few
extracts. He had just received a letter of her’s which pleased him, and
says--

 “I should be ashamed after so long a friendship with you to be
 ignorant of any of your talents, yet I do assure you there are some
 of them that after so long an accquaintance with them, I have not
 yet done admiring. It is never without great delight that I see in
 one whom I esteem so much, that tho’ in company one would swear
 your parts and spirits were contrived purposely for laughter, and
 the chearful round of mirth, yet study and thought, contemplation
 of the ways of men, or works of Nature, and consequently enjoyment
 of yourself, and ease and happiness, the end of all good, never
 desert your leisure and retirement. You never had greater reason
 for this turn of mind, or better trial of your temper on that
 account than lately, when driven from your friends, and almost
 alone, in a manner you never were before, and probably may never be
 again: you were fairly left to the food and entertainment of your
 own thoughts; and though it would be impertinent now to mention
 my general opinion of your letters, I don’t remember that I ever
 saw your thoughts stamped upon a piece of paper with greater force
 of discernment than in the letter I received from you to-day....
 Bating the tribe of your lovers, you cannot have a more hearty
 friend to your person, or more assured admirer of your merit and
 accomplishments.”

Surely few brothers have ever paid a more graceful tribute of praise to
a sister! Matthew was born in 1713, and was consequently seven years
older than Elizabeth.

[Page heading: THE SMALLPOX]

On May 9, in a letter to Mr. Freind, we learn the two sisters had met
again--

 “I had the joy of seeing my dear Pea yesterday; I cannot express
 the happiness of such a meeting, but it is saying enough to own it
 more than recompensed the pangs of parting. It is truly, as well
 as poetically said, ‘The heart can ne’er a transport know, that
 never felt a pain.’ My desire to be cheered again by that beloved
 voice made me desirous of a meeting much sooner than I should be
 otherwise, in my shameful fear of the distemper, have desired. We
 talked about an hour in the open air, at about two yards’ distance:
 she kept her hat so close I could not see her face, but as soon
 as it has nothing left of the distemper, but the redness, I am to
 see her. I am now within sight of our house at a farm just at the
 bottom of the gates. I have a very good room, warm and comfortable.
 It is so low that it flatters my pride by indulging me with an
 approach to the ceiling. My Mamma had sent furniture for the room
 from Mount Morris, as soon as my sister was growing better, that I
 might come so near as to be accustomed to the family, and so return
 to it at leisure without any apprehensions.”

Reproaching Mr. Freind for silence in this letter, he writes, May 19,
in return to plead his parochial duties, and amusingly says in defence--

 “I am forced in the country, every week to make a sermon, at home
 or abroad, however engaged, made it must be, and swallowed the
 next Sunday, though I believe it lies but a crude morsel on the
 Blanketters’[160] Stomachs, which, if they can digest, ’tis often
 more than I myself can do.... An express arrived last night from
 Admiral Vernon; Carthagena was not actually taken, but the captain
 who brings the news imagines it might be taken in about 12 hours
 after he left it. All the Spanish ships and galleons that were
 in the Harbour were burnt, most of the fortifications battered
 down, enough to discover there was great confusion in the town.
 Not a ship of ours was hurt when he departed. But there is always
 a black flag attends in the train of Victory; the general joy
 overcomes indeed all private concern; but those who have friends or
 relations in the midst of a fire, cannot rejoice till they hear who
 has escaped it. Those we lost on the 1st of April are Lord Aubrey
 Beauclerc,[161] who had both legs shot off, and died presently,
 Col. Douglas of the Marines had his head shot off, Lieutenant
 Sandford of Wentworth’s Regiment was shot in his tent before the
 town, Col. Watson of the Artillery was killed by a shot in the
 thigh, Capt. Moor was killed, Lieutenant Turvin had just taken the
 Colours from his dead ensign, and was killed with them in his hand
 (‘There’s honour for you,’ says Sir J. Falstaffe), 197 private men
 are killed and wounded. I was glad to find my brother not mentioned
 in the list.”

    [160] It will be remembered Mr. Freind was Rector of Witney, the
    centre of blanket-making.

    [161] Son of 1st Duke of St. Albans, and grandson of Charles II.

[Page heading: ST. LAZARE]

[Page heading: A SOUTH SEA LAWSUIT]

Alas! in this he was premature, his brother-in-law, Henry Robinson,
died of the wounds he received at the attack on St. Lazare, near
Carthagena. May 12, Mrs. Donnellan writes from London--

 “We are squabbling about Elections, and proving right wrong, and
 wrong right, just as we think it will make for some little private
 interest, without the least regard to truth, justice, or any
 notion of the good of the country. The Westminster Election was
 finished in a most partial manner on Friday, in favour of the Court
 candidates, and Lord Sundon[162] was like to be torn to pieces by
 the mob in revenge: this has been the subject of much talk, and
 last night I happened to say to a clergyman (who I thought by his
 gown was obliged to join with me), that I thought the dishonesty
 that prevailed in Elections was terrible, and corrupted the private
 honesty in all ranks of people, when my Parson to my surprise took
 up the argument that bribery in a King and his Ministers was not
 dishonest, but politic, and that we could not subsist without it,
 and ran on to prove that we must conform to the times, and if my
 neighbour bribes, I must do so too, to be on a foot with him or we
 must be undone. I own this doctrine shocks me....

 “Your friend[163] told me yesterday they are a little disturbed
 about a law suit which is to concern the 28th. I suppose you have
 heard of it. ’Tis an old South Sea affair of the Father’s,[164] and
 very considerable. I am really concerned about it, and shall long
 to see them out of such a terrible situation.”

    [162] William Clayton, Baron Sundon.

    [163] Duchess of Portland.

    [164] William Henry, 1st Duke of Portland.

[Illustration: _Lady Mary Wortley Montagu_

_from a miniature in the possession of Mrs. Climenson_

_Emery Walker Ph. Sc._]

At this period Elizabeth developed a most painful weakness of the eyes,
which recurred at intervals during the rest of her life. She attributed
it to reading so much at night during her absence from home while her
sister was ill. The duchess writes to implore her not to work, or read,
and she answers, “I follow your grace’s advice, I do not work at all,
and I read by my sister’s eyes.” She had commenced dining at Mount
Morris, but they would not let her go upstairs for fear of infection,
so she still slept at the farm. Mr. Freind had in his last letter said,
“Let us know all about you; when you set sail, _i.e._ when you are to
be manned, and who is to be your Captain, for these things surely must
be settled now.” To which she answers--

 “I am not going to set sail yet; the ocean of fortune is rough, the
 bark of fortune light, the prosperous gale uncertain, but the Pilot
 must be smooth, steady and content, patient in storms, moderate and
 careful in sunshine, and easy in the turns of the wind, and changes
 of the times. Guess if these things be easily found? and without
 such a guide can I avoid the gulph of misfortune, the barking of
 envy, the deceits of the syrens, and the hypocrisy of Proteus? So
 I wait on the shore, scarce looking towards this land of promise,
 so few I find with whom I would risk the voyage. I would have
 wrote you a longer letter, if I had a frank, but careful of your
 sixpence, though regardless of your leisure, that consideration
 hinders me. I am at Mount Morris again.”

[Page heading: “LIFE OF CICERO”]

The duchess having commenced reading Dr. Conyers Middleton’s “Life
of Cicero,” Elizabeth recommends a pamphlet called “Observations on
Cicero,” written by Mr. Lyttelton,[165] but without his name being
prefixed to it. She states, “Dr. Middleton compliments it in his
preface slightly; it is as much a criticism as the Doctor’s is a
panegyric of Tully’s action: it is a very little book, but I think
wrote with great spirit and elegance.”

    [165] George, afterwards Lord Lyttelton.

The following letter is from the Duchess of Portland early in June, but
undated:--

  “Monday morning.

  “MY DEAREST FIDGET,

 “You will be much surprised to receive so melancholy a letter from
 me after that strange medley you had last post, but yesterday
 morning I was told the Doctor had no hopes of my Papa; he hurt his
 leg some time ago, and Sergeant Dickens has had it in hand, and
 declared to Dr. Mead[166] he would go on no longer without another
 surgeon was called in, upon which Skipton was sent for, and what
 will be the result of their consultations to-day I dread to know;
 he has besides a jaundice and dropsy. He was out Friday night, and
 pretty well of Saturday night, and grew so much worse yesterday
 morning that he is not able to move. The Doctor was surprised to
 find such an alteration in a few hours. Oh! my dear Fidget, ’tis
 not possible to flatter oneself, God only knows what is best for
 us, therefore I am sensible I ought to be contented with what He is
 pleased to inflict upon us, but I cannot help my natural weakness.
 I can’t see to add any more, my heart and eyes are too full.”

    [166] Famous physician, writer on medicine, and antiquarian.

[Page heading: DEATH OF THE EARL OF OXFORD]

Here Mrs. Donnellan adds, “I have but one sad moment to tell my dear
Fidget that my Lord Oxford[167] died to-day.”

    [167] He died in Dover Street, June 16, 1741.

The next letter from the duchess is dated June 25--

  “MY DEAREST FIDGET,

 “I owe you a thousand thanks for your kind letters, and if words
 were the only acknowledgement I could make, I should ever be
 bankrupt, but my affection is warm, and my fidelity will last as
 long as my life....

 “He was sensible almost to the last, nor did not show the least
 regret at leaving this troublesome world, except when he took leave
 of me, and that was too moving a scene for me even to tell now.” ...

At the end she begs Elizabeth not to write to her, as her eyes were
so bad, but to get Sarah to do so instead, and in all her trouble
remembers to send two bottles of arquebusade to Matthew Robinson’s
chambers which he wanted, the price being 4_s._ 6_d._ a bottle.

Edward, 2nd Earl of Oxford, was the son of Robert, 1st Earl, by his
first marriage with Elizabeth Foley, sister of Thomas, 1st Lord Foley;
he continued to collect the Harleian MSS.,[168] begun by his father,
now in the British Museum, also innumerable books, pictures, medals,
etc.; and took great interest in all archæological studies, as did his
countess.

    [168] Lady Oxford sold the Harleian collection of manuscripts in
    1753 to the British Museum.

Elizabeth wrote to condole heartily with the duchess on her sad loss,
but imploring her, for the sake of the duke and her dear little
children, to endeavour to bear up under this sad blow, for father and
daughter were tenderly attached to each other.

[Page heading: A ONE-HORSE CHAISE]

The universal panacea of bleeding--for one can only judge by the manner
in which doctors applied to it for every case--had been endured by
Elizabeth for the sake of her eyes, and she says “my eyes are worse
for the bleeding.” She had a narrow escape at this time: her brother
Matthew driving her for her health along the seashore on a high bank
raised to keep off the incursion of the sea, the horse bolted, but
fortunately their servant outrider was able to stop it without its
bolting down either side of the bank. It is characteristic of the times
that she calls a one-horse chaise, “of all things the most ridiculous!”

Mrs. Donnellan had been ill, and was ordered to Tunbridge Wells, to
drink the waters. There was hope of Dr. Young being there. “I believe
you will find his thoughts little confined to the place; he will
entertain you with conversation much above what one generally finds
there, where they talk of little but water, bread, butter, and scandal.”

On July 5 the duchess writes to say they had carried their cause in
the law suit. She also expresses her joy at hearing Matthew Robinson
intended to be inoculated that autumn. Elizabeth said if her eyes and
general health were better, she would be inoculated too. She had just
been given, “by a wise son of Æsculapius, a diabolical bolus that half
killed me. I fainted away about three hours after I swallowed the
notable composition, and was above an hour in such agony that if I had
not waited for your letter I had certainly gone to the Elysian fields.”

A letter of Mrs. Botham’s from Elford, of which place, as well as of
Yoxall, Staffordshire, her husband was Vicar, mentions a legacy left to
her and her sister, Mrs. Laurence Sterne--

 “My husband is in the North; his journey thither happened very
 opportunely, for an ancient woman whose very name I am a stranger
 to, has lately dyed intestate, and my Sister and self are heirs at
 law of her real estate, which consists of some houses at Leeds, the
 yearly value of them about £60. It would be well for us if we could
 make out a title to her personal estate, which is upwards of £5000,
 but that I have no hopes of.”

[Page heading: A WINDSOR HATTER]

The duke and duchess were now at Bullstrode, and anxious for Elizabeth
to come to them. The duchess gives an amusing account of a hatter’s
funeral--

 “A hatter of Windsor left £100 to a man on condition he would
 bury him according to his desire under a mulberry tree in his own
 garden, 10 feet deep. The assistants to drink 12 bottles of wine
 over his grave, and French Horns playing during the whole ceremony,
 and this was accordingly performed yesterday, to the great offence
 of Mr. Grosmith,[169] who says he was not a Christian....

 “To dissect leaves[170] put ’em into water, and change the water
 every day, but you must take care the leaf is not blighted.”

    [169] The clergyman.

    [170] To skeletonize leaves.

Mrs. Donnellan writes on September 1 to say she has returned from
Tunbridge Wells after a six weeks’ visit; staying with her married
sister, Mrs. Clayton, and her husband, Robert Clayton, Bishop of
Killala, and afterwards of Clogher. The bishop very nobly gave his
wife’s paternal fortune to her sister, Anne Donnellan. Dr. Young was at
Tunbridge, and Mrs. Donnellan states--

 “I conversed much with Doctor Young, but I had not enough to
 satisfy me. We ran through many subjects, and I think his
 conversation much to my taste. He enters into human nature, and
 both his thoughts and expressions are new.”

[Page heading: THE SCOTTS OF SCOTT’S HALL]

She also mentions that Lady Thanet, accompanied by Mrs. Scott, was at
Tunbridge. Mrs. Scott,[171] of Scott’s Hall, Kent, was a friend of the
Robinsons. She had a large family, seven sons and seven daughters; one
was lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Orange, and married a Monsieur
Saumaize, a member of the suite. Her sister Caroline, or “Cally Scott”
(her pet-name), was the bosom friend of Sarah Robinson, and eventually
married a Mr. Best. Another, Cecilia, who died unmarried, was a friend
to the Robinson family for life. To Mrs. Donnellan Elizabeth writes on
September 13, and in a long letter she says--

    [171] The Scotts of Scott’s Hall were one of the most ancient
    Kentish families, originally Balliols of Scotland.

 “The time for my brother’s inoculation draws near, and though I
 have a very good opinion of that method of having the smallpox, yet
 I cannot enjoy a perfect tranquillity of mind till it is over. I
 would fain persuade him to have it done while I am in the country,
 but he will not grant my request; for my Pappa, I believe, will not
 let me go to Bullstrode at all, if I don’t go before that is over;
 and my brother therefore waits for my departure, that I may not be
 banished for six weeks or two months, which he imagines would be
 melancholy for me these long evenings, as I should have no friend
 with me, and am not able to divert myself with books now my eyes
 are bad.”

The duchess was waiting for Lady Oxford’s departure from Bullstrode.
Lady Oxford is often alluded to as “the Speaker” by the duchess, the
same name, as has been mentioned, was bestowed on Mrs. Robinson by her
children. Elizabeth’s health being so indifferent, her parents wished
her to consult Dr. Mead, and early in October she proceeded to London
with her brother Tom, where she stayed a few days with Mrs. Donnellan
in Bond Street, and on October 13 joined her beloved friends at
Bullstrode, the duchess sending her coach to London to fetch her.

Matthew was to be inoculated as soon as the coach returned to Mount
Morris from taking Elizabeth to town, as, till the smallpox appeared,
he was to take the air daily in it; but the inoculation did not take,
and Elizabeth’s tender fears for her brother were allayed.

[Page heading: MARRIAGE OF LORD SANDWICH]

The next letter of interest is on October 20, to her mother--

 “I return you many thanks for your directions for the apron, which
 I will carefully follow; as to the silver thread I do not approve
 the use of it, as all great artists work for immortality, and my
 sister will find a little time will tarnish her work if there is
 a mixture of silver in it.... I honour Lord Sandwich[172] for his
 wise and generous contempt of money in a point in which there are
 other things superior to it; he bears an excellent character,
 there is much prudence in knowing how to separate one’s particular
 happiness from that which is reckoned so in the world’s opinion:
 if Lord Sandwich takes greater pleasure in the conversation of a
 fine woman than in viewing a collection of medals and pictures,
 he is right to prefer Miss Dolly Fane with £5000 to Miss Spinckes
 with £50,000.... He has a good estate sufficient for the becoming
 state of a nobleman.... Miss Fane is a happy woman to have a lover
 so great, so generous, and so good. Love has a good right over the
 marriages of men, but not of women; for men raise their wives to
 their ranks, women stoop to their husbands, if they choose below
 themselves. I think all our neighbours are in a marrying humour. I
 wish some of them had married two and twenty years ago, we should
 have had now a gallant young neighbourhood.”

    [172] John, 4th Earl Sandwich, whose nickname later was “Jemmy
    Twitcher,” just engaged to Dorothy, daughter of Charles, 1st
    Viscount Fane.

Dr. Mead had prescribed for Elizabeth for her eyes and for a swelled
lip, which annoyed her much. What should we think of a blister applied
to the back to reduce a swelled lip in these days? Yet it was ordered!
Writing to Sarah, she says--

 “I am better than I was, but my mouth not being yet perfectly
 reduced, I have got a fresh blister upon my back, well may it bend
 with such a weight of calamities.... I have sent for my bathing
 Cloaths, and on Sunday night shall take a souze. I think it a
 pleasant remedy. I am to sit a quarter of an hour in the bath, and
 then go to bed and lye warm; it is to be repeated three times a
 week.”

[Page heading: DUCAL BATHS!]

The next letter to her mother throws a curious light on the personal
cleanliness of the day, and the want of baths in a ducal house--

  “November 6, 1741.

  “MADAM,

 “I should write to you much oftener, if I was able, but really I am
 so taken up with the pursuit of health I have little time for other
 employments. My lip is not entirely reduced, though I have been
 blistered twice, once blooded, and have five times taken physick,
 have lived upon chicken and white meats, and drank nothing but
 water; however, I am now vastly better than I was, and have hardly
 any pimples in my face, and no complaint in my eyes or nose, only
 this abominable lip is still rather bigger than it used to be. I
 intend to keep the blister going till it is well, for Mr. Clarke
 has put me in a way of doing it, so that I do not suffer much. I
 have suffered great disappointment about the warm bath, which I am
 advised to try, for the bathing tubs are so out of order we have
 not yet been able to make them hold water, but I hope next week
 they will serve the purpose.” ...

At the end of the letter is this: “Mary brings me word my bathing
tub[173] is ready for use; so to-morrow I shall go in. Pray look for my
bathing dress, till then I must go in in chemise and jupon!” Evidently
from this it was not considered proper to go into a bath, even in a
bedroom, _au naturel_!

    [173] Before tin baths came into use, I remember my father bathing
    in a wooden tub, which resembled a wheelbarrow without legs or
    wheels, but with two handles at each end. It took two maids to
    empty it.

[Page heading: THE NEW LADY’S-MAID]

[Page heading: A MICROSCOPE]

Another light on domestic service of the day is given in the next
letter to Sarah. For some reason Elizabeth had a new lady’s-maid, and
it appears from this and other letters that a superior class of persons
officiated in that capacity. Many a clergyman’s daughter was glad to be
lady’s-maid or housekeeper in those days--

 “I like my maid extreamly; she is very humble, sensible, quick and
 diligent, and though her Father and Mother are above the common
 rate, she has never presumed to hint she was a person of fashion,
 which the French generally brag of. Mrs. Hog[174] (ye ladies’
 French woman), tells me Mr. Dufour was a scarlet Dyer, worth once
 five or six thousand pounds, and Mrs. Dufour had about £1600 for
 her fortune, but by the knavery of a partner in their trade, they
 were reduced. I think Mary works pretty quick, and washes well, and
 is very handy, and she talks much better French than Dulac.

 “I am reading Dr. Swift’s and Mr. Pope’s letters. I like them much,
 and find great marks of friendship, goodness and affection between
 these people whom the world is apt to think too wise to be honest,
 and too witty to be affectionate, but vice is the child of folly,
 rather than of wisdom; and for insensibility of heart, like that
 of the head, it belongeth unto fools. Lord Bolingbroke’s letters
 shine much in the collection. We are reading Dr. Middleton’s new
 edition[175] of his letter from Rome, but have not yet come to the
 postscript to Warburton;[176] the answer to the Roman Catholic is
 full, and I doubt not the Protestant will be as happily silenced.
 Truth will maintain its ground against all opposition.

 “We expect Mr.[177] and Mrs. West, and then we shall have the house
 full. We are in hopes of Dr. Young; he is now at Welling sowing
 spiritual things in his parish, I hope to the increase of grace.

 “The sun will not shine for our microscope,[178] which is a great
 vexation to the curious. Last night by the candle I saw a fringe
 upon a leaf, that would have done excellently well for your apron,
 and I dare say you are so excellently skilled in the imitation of
 Nature that you could work just like it if you had the materials.”

    [174] French maid to the duchess’s little girls.

    [175] “Letters on the Use and Study of History.”

    [176] William Warburton, D.D., Bishop of Gloucester, friend of
    Pope; able controversial writer; born 1698, died 1779.

    [177] Gilbert T. West, LL.D., born 1706, died 1756; poet and
    writer; translated “Pindar.”

    [178] Mr. Achard’s microscope.

In the next letter to Sarah she says--

 “The Muses, fair ladies and Mr. Lyttelton,[179] a fine gentleman,
 will entertain you in my absence _d’esprit_: the verses were wrote
 at Lord Westmorland’s. I think the verses are pretty; either I am
 very partial to the writer, or Mr. Lyttelton has always something
 of an elegance and agreeableness in all his verses, let the subject
 be ever so trifling.... Does the world want odd people, or do we
 want strange cousins that the Sternes must increase and multiply?
 No folly ever becomes extinct, fools do so establish posterity!”

    [179] George, afterwards Lord Lyttelton.

As the Sternes’ eldest child, the first Lydia, was not born till 1745,
there must have been a disappointment; but though undated, this letter
is of 1741, as allusion is made to Matthew Robinson’s inoculation,
which had just taken place.

[Page heading: “CIBBER’S LIFE”]

“We are reading ‘Cibber’s Life.’[180] Was there ever so exquisite a
coxcomb!”

    [180] Cibber’s “Apology for his Life,” published this year; he did
    not die till 1757, but published his “Apology” in 1740.

November 11, a letter contains--

 “Last night being the birthday of the noble Admiral Vernon, we
 drank his health at noon, and celebrated the same with a ball
 at night. The ‘Gun Fleet’ was danced in honour of him, and all
 celebrated with extream joy, and a splendid distribution of Crowns
 to the fiddler, who was not the son of Orpheus, but however he made
 such a difference between tit-for-tat and a minouet, that one might
 understand which he meant. Mademoiselle Dufour[181] had the honour
 of standing up instead of a flower-pot or an elbow-chair; she
 danced like the daughter of Herodias.”

    [181] Her French attendant; see _ante_.

To Mrs. Donnellan, who had been ill, but was recovering, this
description of Dr. Young[182] is addressed--

 “We have lost our divines, whose company we regret; there is
 great pleasure in conversing with people of such a turn as Dr.
 Young and Dr. Clarke;[183] for the first there is nothing of
 speculation, either in the Terra Firma of Reason, or the Visionary
 province of fancy, into which he does not lead the imagination.
 In his conversation he examines everything, determines hardly
 anything, but leaves one’s judgment at liberty. The other goes far
 into a subject, and seldom leaves the conclusion of an argument
 unfinished; he seems to me to have a very accurate judgment, and
 a very attentive observation of everything that comes within his
 view, and thus with the assistance of a happy memory, he has laid
 up a great stock of knowledge and experience.”

    [182] Dr. Young lost his wife this year, 1741.

    [183] Dr. W. Clarke, died 1771; divine and writer.

[Page heading: MECHANICAL CHAIR]

Mrs. Donnellan mentions on November 15 a mechanical chair she is to
have for exercise--

 “An artist is to bring me home a machine[184] for galloping and
 trotting this day; if I could get him to make me one that could
 move me from one place to another, with how much pleasure could
 I mount my chariot to make you a visit.... London is as full now
 as it used to be in January. Plays are much frequented, both to
 see Barbarini dance, and a new actress from Ireland, her name is
 Woffington,[185] ... she excels in men’s parts, and is to act
 ‘Sir Harry Wildair’ next Monday, by the King’s commands, and all
 the world goes. We poor Irish run the gauntlet about her; we hear
 in many companys, ‘She has a great deal of _Irish assurance_.’ I
 desired it should be called _Stage assurance_.

 “Handel[186] next week has a new opera, which those who have heard
 the rehearsal say is very pretty. Tell Pen the ‘Lion Song’ is in
 it....

 “I hear the Duke of Portland is to have a Blue Garter, which I am
 extremely glad of, as I think ’tis fit and proper.”

    [184] Called a “Merlin Chair,” from the inventor, for mechanical
    exercise.

    [185] Margaret Woffington, born 1718, died 1760; celebrated actress
    and friend of Garrick.

    [186] Does she mean “The Messiah,” which he produced this year, but
    which at first was not appreciated?

To this letter Elizabeth replies--

 “The date of your letter from London is the strongest temptation to
 me to wish myself there, that you could lay before me: as for Plays
 and the Beau monde, I hardly wear vanity enough in the country, to
 wishing myself once more in--

    “‘The dull farce, the empty show
    Of Powder, pocket glass and Beau.’

 “I know your town is the Kingdom of Cards, and the Reign of
 Mattadores I am disaffected to; here I enjoy all the pleasures of
 friendship, and the satisfaction of tranquillity....

 “I hope you will find great benefit by your machine; if you will
 appoint a time for your imagination to take a flight, I will mount
 the Marquis of Lichfield’s Hobby Horse, and give you a meeting.
 Imagination gives Pegasus wings, and he often flies into the
 undiscovered country of fancy.”

[Page heading: MRS. WOFFINGTON]

Mrs. Donnellan writes again on December 1 to say she and her sister,
Mrs. Clayton, had been to two plays in one week--

 “One of our plays was to see Mrs. Woffington perform the part of
 ‘Sir Harry Wild-air,’[187] and indeed I never saw anything done
 with more life and spirit; but at the same time she looked too
 young, too handsome, and her voice seemed more proper for Opera
 than the play; so that we see when things are out of nature, though
 they may have many beauties, in the whole they will not please, and
 a beard and a deep voice are as proper to make a man agreeable, as
 a soft voice and smooth face to a woman.”

    [187] From the play of _The Constant Couple_.

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH]

The next letter of interest is of December 12, to Mrs. Robinson, from
Elizabeth--

  “MADAM,

 “It is long since I have had the pleasure of writing to you, for
 though I have much inclination to do so, I have little leisure. I
 am now coming on you with a great deal of news from the city of our
 Great King. The Parliament is all in a flame, the Court have had
 but a majority of seven. There is a great struggle between Giles,
 Earle, and Dr. Lee, which shall be for the Committees. The city is
 in great alarm that they are going to lose six hundred thousand
 pounds out of Leghorn, which it is expected will be taken, and the
 Port lost to our merchants.

 “Now as to private affairs, it is reported the Dowager Duchess of
 Marlborough[188] is dead, that she departed last night, and no one
 weeps for her to-day. Extravagance will lavish away those treasures
 her avarice accumulated.... I am not sure the report is true,
 though private letters and public papers do affirm that the spirit
 of pride, avarice, and ambition have stolen from her as quietly as
 the common breath of the nostrils....”

    [188] Sarah Jennings, born 1660, died 1744.

The duchess did not die then, as will be seen by the next letter to the
same person. This was the illness when the doctor told her, unless she
was blistered, she would die, when she cried, “I _won’t_ be blistered,
and I _won’t_ die!” And she did not, for she lived till 1744!

  “December 19, 1741.

  “MADAM,

 “I believe the wars abroad, and tumults at home, will make the
 publick papers worth reading. Dr. Lee has carried his Election
 by four, the Court is concerned at it. The King[189] suspended
 even his dinner (an action of as great importance as any done in
 the reigns of some Monarchs) till this affair between Dr. Lee and
 Earle was determined. The Westminster Election will now be carried
 against the Court. It is thought Lord Percival will undoubtedly be
 chosen at the new Election. The friends of Sir R----[190] lament
 that now he will not be able to carry any of the petitions, but
 where the right is on his side, and which, too, is looked upon by
 them as an unfortunate thing for the Kingdom in general.

 “The Duchess of Marlborough is not dead yet, but in great danger;
 she has St. Anthony’s fire to a terrible degree, and will have no
 advice but such as her apothecary gives her. To Mr. Spencer[191]
 she has bequeathed in her will £30,000 a year, in addition to what
 he has already. The Duchess of Manchester[192] she has struck out.
 How the rest of her enormous fortune is disposed of people do not
 know.

 “We lost two of our Divines to-day, Dr. Young and the Dean
 of Exeter, men of very different genius, but both agreeable
 companions.”

    [189] George II.

    [190] Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister, born 1676, died 1745.

    [191] Her grandson.

    [192] Her eldest granddaughter.

[Page heading: CZARINA ELIZABETH]

The next is to Sarah, December 22, and in it is--

 “I don’t know whether you have heard of the Revolutions in Russia,
 that the Princess Eliza[193] is made Czarina; the Czar, his Mother,
 Munich and Lacy imprisoned, and all by the power of France, and
 the machinations of General Keith.[194] This is bad news for poor
 England. The members of Parliament of the country party are gone
 to their firesides to roast chestnuts, while the Court get the
 uppermost again. The Prince’s affair is to come before the House
 very soon: it is a shame that he[195] has no settlement.”

    [193] Elizabeth Petrowna, born 1709, died 1761; daughter of Peter
    the Great.

    [194] Field-Marshal Keith, born 1696, died 1758.

    [195] Frederick, Prince of Wales, born 1707, died 1751.

[Page heading: THE REV. JOHN BOTHAM]

Two letters of December 26 and December 31 to Sarah wind up the year.
In the first she mentions that the move from Bullstrode to London was
to take place on January 3, and she was to return to Mount Morris on
the 5th. In passing through London she should visit Mrs. Cotes,[196]
who was a bosom friend of hers and Sarah. A little paragraph occurs
about Mrs. Botham, Mrs. Sterne’s sister--

 “Mrs. Botham is at Elford with Lady Andover, which I am glad of,
 for poor Lydia has a taste for conversation above the hum-drum
 mediocrity of her husband’s understanding. He has a very good
 pulpit drone, and gives the whole parish an excellent nap every
 Sunday with his sermonical lullaby.”

    [196] Wife of Dr. Cotes, of Wimbledon, sister of Henry, Viscount
    Irvine, born 1691, died 1761.

  “December 31, 1741.

  “MY DEAR SISTER,

 “This day did not begin with the auspicious appearance of a letter
 from you; I am glad it is not the first day of the New Year, for I
 might have been superstitious upon it. I hope you kept your letter
 back a day on purpose to welcome in the coming year. I wish it may
 be our lot ever to find the next bring us what the last wanted. But
 alas! time steals the most precious pleasures from us. Our life
 is like a show that has passed by, leaves but a track that makes
 remembrance and reflection rugged, a mark is worn for ever where
 the gay train of pleasures pass’d swiftly by, and observation is
 much longer displeased than ever it was delighted. I am loth to
 part with an old year as with an old acquaintance, not that I have
 to it the gratitude one has to a Benefactor, or the affection one
 bears to a friend. I am, I fear, neither better nor richer than it
 found me, but we lived easy together, and not knowing whether I
 shall have the acquaintance of many years, I could be willing to
 stop this. I have one obligation to it that I rate highly, that
 it has ensured you from the danger of smallpox. This year too has
 allowed us many happy months together. I hope all that are behind
 for me design the same, else they will come unwelcome, and depart
 unregretted.... This day sennight I shall be with you and the good
 family at Horton, telling a ‘Winter’s tale’ by the fireside! Oh
 that we were all to meet then, that once graced that fireside, even
 the goodly nine,[197] and thanking my Father and Mother for all
 the life they imparted to us, and have since supported! I hope the
 flock is safe and our meeting reserved for some of the golden days
 of fate.”

Thomas Robinson, the second brother, had this year brought out his
celebrated legal book, entitled “Common Law of Kent, or the Customs of
Gavel Kind, with an appendix concerning Borough English,” to this day
a well-referred-to book. In 1822 a third edition was published, and
another in 1858, revised by J. D. Norwood. Thomas was of Lincoln’s Inn,
was admitted April 14, 1730. The “National Biography” states he was
never called to the Bar, which must be a mistake, as there is frequent
mention of his pleading cases at Canterbury and elsewhere in the
manuscripts.

[Year: 1742]

[Page heading: NEW YEAR’S DAY]

This year opens with a letter to Mrs. Donnellan, a portion of which I
copy--

  “Bullstrode, January 1, 1742.

  “DEAR MRS. DONNELLAN,

 “Though there is no day of the year in which one does not wish all
 happiness to one’s friends, this is the particular day in which
 the heart goes forth in particular vows and wishes for the welfare
 of those it loves. It is the birth of a new year, whose entrance
 we would salute, and hope auspicious; nor is this particular mark
 of time of little use: it teaches us to number our days, which a
 wise man thought an incitement to the well spending them; and,
 indeed, did we consider how much the pleasure and profit of our
 lives depends upon an economy of our time, we should not waste it
 as we do, in idle repentance, or reflection on the past, or a vain
 unuseful regard for the future. In youth we defer being prudent
 till we are old, and look forward to a promise of wisdom as the
 portion of latter years: when we are old we seek not to improve,
 and scarce employ ourselves; looking backward to our youth as to
 the day of our diligence, and take a pride in laziness, saying we
 rest as after the accomplishment of our undertakings; but we ought
 to ask for our daily merit, as for our daily bread. The mind, no
 more than the body, can be sustained by the food taken yesterday,
 or promised for to-morrow. Every day ought to be considered as
 a period apart, some virtue should be exercised, some knowledge
 improved, and the value of happiness well understood, some pleasure
 comprehended in it; some duty to ourselves or others must be
 infringed if any of these things are neglected....

 “I beg of you to reserve Monday morning for me, and I will spend it
 all with you; on Tuesday I set out for Mount Morris, and on Sunday
 night Pen[198] desires you to be at her house. I hope to return to
 you in the beginning of March for between two and three months.
 Our happy society is just breaking up, but I will think of it with
 gratitude, and not with regret, and thank Fate for the joyful hours
 she lent me....

 “This year does not promise me much pleasure as the last has
 afforded me here, but the fairest gifts of fate come often
 unexpected.”

    [198] Mrs. Pendarves.

[Page heading: LORD GEORGE BENTINCK]

This sentence was, had she known it, prophetic, for this very year
was to furnish her with an excellent and loving husband, a position
of importance, and a plentiful fortune. In a letter to Sarah at this
period mention is made by Elizabeth of Lord George Bentinck (the duke’s
uncle) having been ill, and the means taken for his recovery!--

 “Lord George is much better than he was, and Drs. Mead and Sandys
 have not determined whether it _is_ gout. I hope it is not; he has
 been _blooded forty ounces_ within this week, and they say looks as
 florid as ever!”

[Page heading: NORTHFLEET FAIR]

Elizabeth now left the duchess, joining her sister, who was in town
with her friend, Mrs. Cotes, and writes to her beloved duchess from
Sittingbourne, their halting-place _en route_ home. In this letter she
says--

 “When I arrived at Northfleet, where we dined, every Phillis and
 Corydon were at a fair in the town, and to enter into the humours
 of the place, I walked through it. In one booth were nymphs and
 swains buying garters, with amorous posies, some only with the
 humble request, ‘When these you see, remember me’; others with a
 poetical and more familiar ‘Be true to me, as I’m to thee.’ Under
 another booth, for the pleasure of bold British youths, was Admiral
 Vernon in gingerbread; indeed he appeared in many shapes there,
 and the curate of the parish carried him home in a brass tobacco
 stopper. I was a little concerned to see him lying in passive
 gingerbread, upon a stall with Spanish nuts; but the politicians
 of our age are wonderful in reconciling the interest of nations.
 I assure you there was a great deal of company; many hearts did
 I see exchanged for fairings of cherry-coloured ribbon; and one
 Cymon more polished than the rest, presented his damsel with a fan,
 with the intent, I presume, not to give ‘coolness to the matchless
 Dame.’”

Of politics and the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, we now gain a
glimpse in a letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s of January 14 to Elizabeth--

 “It is certainly believed that the King has sent an offer of a
 reconciliation, and that tempter gold, to the Prince[199] by the
 Bishop of Oxford,[200] whose answer was that while Sir Robert, who
 he apprehended had raised his Majesty’s resentment against him, was
 at Court, he could not appear there, but that if he was removed, he
 would fly without any other conditions but to have the happiness of
 throwing himself at his Majesty’s feet.”

    [199] Frederick, Prince of Wales, then on very bad terms with his
    father.

    [200] Thomas Secker, born 1693, died 1768; afterwards Archbishop of
    Canterbury.

[Page heading: SIR ROBERT WALPOLE]

The duchess, writing on January 23, says, “Sir Robert carried the
question by three votes.”

In the same letter she says, “I am just come from Court, where I saw
your incomparable cousin kiss hands for the government of Barbadoes;
now he certainly goes, I will pay my civilities to him in hopes of
getting some shells!” This was Sir Thomas Robinson,[201] who, having
almost ruined himself with his improvements at Rokeby, and his enormous
and frequent entertainments, applied for the governorship on economic
reasons, and continued governor till 1747.

    [201] “Long” Sir Thomas Robinson, as he was called to distinguish
    him from another baronet of the same name. See note at end of book
    on him.

On February 4 the duchess writes in bad spirits to “Fidget”; the duke
was ill with the gout, and her little girl, Lady Fanny, had had a
convulsion fit, for which “she was blistered and blooded within 12
hours:” drastic treatment for an unfortunate infant not a year old! In
this letter we read--

 “The King sent Sir Robert word that he had no more orders for him,
 and that he must resign, but that he made him Earl of Orford.
 Others report that upon his losing the election of Bainton,
 Rolt, and Sir Edmund Thomas, he went to the King and told him
 the current ran so strongly against him he could no longer be of
 service to him, but that he would come into the House of Lords.
 Lord Wilmington[202] is to act as first Lord of the Treasury till
 affairs are settled. It is said the Duke of Richmond[203] has given
 up, that Sir William Young and Winnington are to be turned out,
 Harry Pelham to be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and there is
 a patent drawing for Miss Walpole[204] to take the place of Lord
 Orford’s daughter.”

    [202] Earl of Wilmington, died 1743.

    [203] Charles, 2nd Duke.

    [204] Miss Skerrit, illegitimate daughter of Sir Robert.

[Page heading: LORD ORFORD]

On February 9 Mrs. Pendarves writes the following:--

  “Clarges Street, February 9, 1742.

 “My dear Miss Robinson will think me very dilatory in obeying her
 commands, but the uneasy situation I have been in, surrounded by
 sick friends[205] and servants, must make an excuse for me.

 “Burnet,[206] I hope is safe on your table, and has by this time
 given you some entertainment.

 “As for the fringe it should have been sent to you sooner, could I
 have found it, but it was buried under such a variety of rubbish
 it was like digging in a mine to find it. Don’t let these delays
 discourage you from making use of me again, for no one can take
 more pleasure in being your humble servant than I do. This is
 asserting a bold truth, and would draw on me numbers of challenges,
 if I published it. I should not be afraid of accepting the combat
 where my cause was so good. Our letters crost on the road. Your
 observation on retirement is very just, and all your thoughts show
 the good use you make of Retirement; but I wish for my own sake to
 draw you out of it. I am not so unreasonable as to expect to hear
 often from you. I can’t justly make that demand, but if you were
 in town I should endeavour to have a great deal of your company;
 let me know when I may hope to see you. At present I can give you
 no very inviting reason for coming; as to the entertainments of
 the place, all parties are out of humour; everybody conjectures
 something; nobody knows anything, but that Sir R(obert) W(alpole)
 kissed hands yesterday as Lord Orford, and his daughter as Lady
 Mary, that he resigned yesterday, and goes to Houghton in a few
 days. His faithful services to his King are well rewarded. I have
 been interrupted by two favourites of yours, Lord Cornbury and Mrs.
 Donnellan, and to recommend them still stronger to your favour,
 they have prevented your having a dull long letter. I send the
 fringe enclosed; if I wait till my spirit is more alert you may
 want your apron, and think I have quite neglected your orders. I
 will run any hazard rather than give you just cause to complain of
 me, and am with great sincerity,

  “My dear Fidget,
  “Yours most faithfully,

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF NORFOLK’S MASQUERADE]

On February 11 the duchess writes--

 “Great changes have been wrought to-day, Mr. Sandys has kissed
 hands as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Carteret,[207] is to
 be Secretary of State,[208] Lord Harrington, President of the
 Council, Mr. Pulteney[209] and Lord Winchelsea[210] are to go to
 Court to-morrow; and all affairs are to be transacted by the advice
 of Pulteney and Pelham. Lord Cobham[211] has hindered the Prince
 coming to Court, but it is to be hoped he will be persuaded to
 the contrary. The Duchess of Norfolk is to have a masquerade next
 Wednesday, so that I am in the greatest of hurrys to get ready. I
 am to be ‘Night.’”

    [207] Afterwards Earl Granville, born 1690, died 1763.

    [208] William, 1st Earl, born 1690, died 1756.

    [209] Afterwards Earl of Bath, born 1684, died July 8, 1764.

    [210] Daniel, 8th Earl, born 1689, died 1769.

    [211] Sir Richard Temple, made Baron Cobham, born 1669, died 1749.

On the same day Mrs. Donnellan writes that--

 “The Duchess of Norfolk’s[212] masquerade employs the gay world
 as much at present as the Court places does the ambitious. The
 Duchess, Lady Andover, and Pen have their tickets, poor Dash[213]
 fears she will not have one. The Duchess is to represent ‘Night,’
 and you know she has stars to adorn it, and make it bright as day.
 Lady Andover and Pen are to be dressed after Holler’s Prints. I
 have desired they make this house their place of meeting, and shall
 desire the same of all my acquaintance, which will give me all I
 care for of a masquerade.”

Another peep at the masquerade is gained by a letter from “Cally” Scott
to the two Robinson sisters--

 “The Princess of Wales[214] was the finest figure that ever was
 seen; she had a vast number of jewels, and was in Queen Elizabeth’s
 dress: the Duchess of Portland’s was very odd and pretty, her upper
 part was night, and the lower moonshine.”

    [214] Augusta of Saxe Gotha, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales.

[Page heading: SIR HANS SLOANE]

The duchess writes early in February--

  “MY DEAREST FIDGET,

 “Though I shall have the pleasure of seeing you soon, yet I can’t
 help conversing with you as often as it is in my power. I am but
 just come from Sir Hans Sloane’s,[215] where I have beheld many
 odder things than himself, though none so inconsistent: however, I
 will not rail, for he has given me some of his trumpery to add to
 my collection, and till I get better they shall remain there....

 “The Duchess of Marlborough’s Memoirs[216] are come out. I long
 to read ’em, and hear she has given my grandfather a character,
 entirely worthy of herself, to show posterity how very different
 they were in all circumstances of life. If she makes her character
 to answer his, she has given him a great foil which his virtue
 did not require. Swift’s ‘Four last years of Queen Anne’[217] are
 coming out. I don’t hear they are yet printed.”

[Page heading: HOUSE OF LORDS]

Elizabeth now went to London, and in February writes this interesting
letter to her father in Kent--

  “SIR,

 “I thought it would be agreeable to you to have an account of the
 mighty and important proceedings of both houses yesterday, so I
 have sent you the question, which was debated in both Houses with a
 good deal of warmth. It was brought into the House of Lords by Lord
 Carteret,[218] who spoke two hours in opening. Lord Carlisle and
 Lord Westmorland spoke with great warmth, and Lord Carlisle[219]
 was very bitter. Lord Halifax[220] seconded Lord Carteret. Lord
 Talbot said in answer to the Duke of Marlborough’s motion (that it
 might be voted that an attempt to inflict any kind of punishment,
 etc., etc.) that he would not say that all persons were interested
 that spoke in favour of Sir Robert, that they appeared to be so,
 and upon being called to order, he said with heat that he was used
 to speak truth, and he did believe (by the most sacred oath) that
 they were so, and that he was ready to give any man satisfaction
 that would require it. All moderate men voted with the majority in
 both Houses. Lord Cornbury and Mr. Harley spoke in favour of Sir
 R.: the latter said that though Sir R. had pursued a relation[221]
 of his without evidence, and caused his imprisonment, and thereby
 the shortening of his life, he could not, as he had differed from
 him in all his measures, copy him in that, and so withdrew with
 his brother and many others who had great disobligations to the
 Member. Mr. Skipper would not vote against the great man, for it
 seems there was no proof nor evidence of the accusations. I think
 the majority was 290 against 190 in the House of Commons. Many of
 the Country interest did not vote at all; they did not break up
 till three. The House of Lords at one o’clock in the morning. Mr.
 Sandys[222] opened very well, and Mr. ‘Ste’-Fox[223] spoke on the
 other side extremely well. I may by the next post, be able to give
 you a further account of the matter, but this is all I have yet
 heard, for the Members of Parliament are half asleep to-day.

  “I am, Sir,
  “Your most dutiful, etc.”

[Page heading: THE HOUSE’S ADDRESS]

On the other side of this folio letter, in _another handwriting_, is
_the Question_--

 “The House was moved that an humble Address be presented to his
 Majesty, most humbly to advise and beseech his Majesty that he
 will be most graciously pleased to Remove the Right Honble. Sir
 Robert Walpole, Kt. of the most noble order of the Garter, first
 Commissioner of his Majesty’s Treasury, and Chancellor of the
 Exchequer, and one of his Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council,
 from his Majesty’s Presence and Councils for ever,

 “And a question being stated thereupon after long Debate,

 “The Question was put, whether such an address shall be presented
 to his Majesty.

 “It was resolved in the Negative. Contents 47, Proxies 12: 59. Not
 Contents 89, Proxies 19: 108.

 “Then it was likewise moved that an attempt to inflict any kind
 of Punishment on any Person without allowing him an opportunity
 to make his defence, or without proof of any crime or misdemeanor
 committed by him, is contrary to natural Justice, the fundamental
 Laws of this Realm, and by ancient established usage of Parliament,
 and is a high infringement of the Liberties of the Subject. After
 further debate, The Previous Question being put, whether that
 Question shall now be put?

 “It was resolved in the Affirmative.

 “Then the Main Question was put, and it was resolved in ye
 Affirmative. Contents 81, Not Contents 54.”

[Page heading: THE OPERA]

[Page heading: GARRICK]

Elizabeth, in a letter to the Rev. William Freind, gives us an insight
into the Opera of that period--

 “I was at the Opera on Saturday night, where was all the world. I
 was very well diverted between the Opera and the Audience, or I
 ought rather to say the Spectators, for they came to see and not to
 hear. I heard the Elephant was the finest thing in the Opera, but
 that was contradicted, and the burning of the Temple was preferred
 to it. To accommodate everything to the absurdity of the Town, the
 dancing is rendered more ridiculous and grotesque than ever. I was
 thinking if the Court of Augustus could have seen the polite part
 of our nation, admiring a wooden Elephant, with two lamps stuck for
 eyes, and poor Scipio and Asdrubal could have risen to have seen
 themselves covered with silver spangles, and quavering an Italian
 Air, what an honest indignation and scorn would they have conceived
 at us....

 “My Sister Pea is abroad; I am confined again by a little
 feverishness. I thought as it was a London fever it might be
 polite, so I carried it to the Ridotto, Court, and Opera, but it
 grew so perverse and stubborn, so I put it into a White Hood and
 double handkerchief, and kept it by the fire these three days, and
 it is better; indeed I hope it is worn out. On Saturday I intend to
 go to Goodman’s Fields to see Garrick[224] act Richard III.: that
 I may get one cold from a regard to sense, I have sacrificed enough
 to folly in catching colds at the Great Puppet Shows in town.

       *       *       *       *       *

 “I must tell you advice is to me this morning, that Anson[225] had
 taken three Ships laden with silver, and is going to Chagre, and
 from thence to Panama; Vernon and Wentworth are to go with him, and
 Trelawney is to accompany them to reconcile their resolutions.”

    [224] David Garrick, born 1716, died 1779. Made his first
    appearance on the stage in 1741.

    [225] Admiral Lord Anson, born 1697, died 1762. Eminent naval
    commander.

At this period Morris Robinson lost his beloved college friend, a Mr.
Carter, a most promising youth, from smallpox. Morris attended him
until his death, and was almost inconsolable for his loss.




CHAPTER IV.

ENGAGEMENT AND EARLY MARRIED LIFE.


I have made but few allusions to Elizabeth’s love triumphs, but as
the time approaches when she was to make her final choice, I must now
allude to them. There was a certain “Mr. B.,” from what I can gather
a Mr. Brockman, of Beechborough, a fine place near Mount Morris, who
had been desperately in love with her for some time; he is frequently
alluded to in the family letters. In one to Sarah at this period
Elizabeth says--

 “Poor Mr. B. really takes his misfortunes so to heart that he is
 literally dying, indeed I hear he is very ill, which I am sorry
 for, but I have no balsam of heartsease for him, if he should die
 I will have him buried in Westminster Abbey next the woman that
 died of a prick of a finger, for it is quite as extraordinary, and
 he shall have his figure languishing in wax, with ‘Miss Robinson,
 fecit,’ wrote over his head; upon my word I compassionate his
 pains, and pity him, but as I am as compassionate, I am as cold too
 as Charity. He pours out his soul in lamentations to his friends,
 and ‘all but the nymph that should redress his wrong, attend his
 passion and approve his song,’ for the Rhyme will have it so. I am
 glad he has such a stock of flesh to waste upon. Waller says that--

    “‘Sleep from careful Lovers flies
    To bathe himself in Sacharissa’s eyes.’”

[Page heading: LOVERS]

A certain captain, name unknown, also inveigled the Rev. William Freind
to a coffee-house to talk two hours by the clock of Miss Elizabeth
Robinson’s perfections. About this Elizabeth writes to Mr. Freind--

 “I am very sorry if the poor man is really what you think, unhappy;
 if his case is uneasy I am sure it is desperate; complaint I
 hope, is more the language, than misery the condition, of lovers.
 To speak ingenuously you men use us oddly enough, you adore the
 pride, flatter the vanity, gratify the ill-nature, and obey the
 tyranny that insults you; then slight the love, despise the
 affection, and enslave the obedience that would make you happy:
 when frowning mistresses all are awful goddesses, when submissive
 wives, despicable mortals. There are two excellent lines which have
 made me ever deaf to the voice of the charmer, charm’d he ever so
 sweetly--

    “‘The humblest Lover when he lowest lies,
    Submits to conquer, and but kneels to rise.’

 “Flattery has ever been the ladder to power, and I have detested
 its inverted effects of worshipping one into slavery, while it
 has pretended to adore one to Deification. If ever I commit
 my happiness to the hands of any person, it must be one whose
 indulgence I can trust, for flattery I cannot believe. I am sure I
 have faults, and am convinced a husband will find them, but wish
 he may forgive them; but vanity is apt to seek the admirer, rather
 than the friend, not considering that the passion of love may, but
 the effect of esteem can never, degenerate to dislike. I do not
 mean to exclude Love, but I mean to guard against the fondness that
 arises from personal advantages.... I have known many men see all
 the cardinal virtues in a good complexion, and every ornament of
 a character in a pair of fine eyes, and they have married these
 perfections, which might perhaps shine and bloom a twelvemonth, and
 then alas! it appeared these fine characters were only written in
 white and red.

 “A long and intimate acquaintance is the best presage of future
 agreement. I have strengthened this argument to myself by the
 example of you and Mrs. Freind. I hope in my long and tedious
 dissertation I have said nothing disrespectful of Love. As for your
 particular inducement to it I cannot tell whether it was beauty or
 good qualities, they being united in her in a degree of perfection
 not to be excelled.”

After wishing the rejected lover “Riches and alliance to help his
laudable ambition,” she concludes with, “I wish the same advantages for
myself, with one of established fortune and character, so established,
that one piece of generosity should not hurt his fortune, nor one act
of indiscretion prejudice his character.”

[Page heading: SIR GEORGE LYTTELTON]

Who this particular individual was is not now known, but that Elizabeth
was the cynosure of all eyes from her wit, beauty, and vivacity is
shown by her brothers’ letters of this period, which constantly allude
to her troop of admirers. Mr. Lyttelton, now Sir George Lyttelton, the
only single man whom she had ever mentioned with uniform admiration,
married this year, on June 15, Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq.,
of Filleigh, Devonshire, a marriage of the purest affection on both
sides.

In a letter at the end of 1741 she states that her father’s steward
in Yorkshire had been guilty of peccadilloes, and that she was to
accompany her parents to Yorkshire in early spring, where her father
promised her attendance at the York races, in lieu of the Canterbury
ones, which then appeared to her a poor substitute. Whilst in Yorkshire
she either met for the first time, or more probably renewed her
acquaintance with, Mr. Edward Montagu, her future husband, of whom some
account must now be given.

[Page heading: MR. EDWARD MONTAGU]

Edward Montagu was the son of Charles Montagu, fifth son of the great
Earl of Sandwich,[226] Lord High Admiral of the Fleet to Charles II.,
and who had acted as his proxy at his marriage with Catherine of
Braganza. Charles Montagu married twice. By his first wife, Elizabeth
Foster, he had one son, James; he married for second wife Sarah Rogers,
daughter of John Rogers and his wife, _née_ Margaret Cock. The Rogers
owned large estates at Newcastle-on-Tyne[227] and in its neighbourhood.
Charles Montagu, by his second marriage, had three sons, Edward, Crewe,
and John, and a daughter, Jemima, who was married at the time I am
writing of to Mr. Sydney Medows, afterwards Sir Sydney Medows. Mr.
Edward Montagu was born in 1691, hence he was twenty-nine years older
than Elizabeth. At the time he courted Elizabeth, another admirer, a
young nobleman, whose name I know not, is stated to have been in love
with her, but constant to her former protestation of choosing a “formed
character” that she could look up to, she chose the older man. It is
odd not a sentence is met with about him before, except that one of
her brothers chaffs her about “converting a Mr. M---- to dancing,”
which may have referred to him. He was a profound mathematician, the
friend of Emerson and other learned men of that day. His character
was amiable, equable, just, and of the highest integrity, as is shown
by his letters, and his political conduct as a Member of Parliament
in what was a corrupt age. Mrs. Carter[228] mentions him “as a man of
sense, a scholar, and a mathematician” in her letters. He owned a good
estate at Allerthorpe, Yorkshire, and another near Rokeby (the fine
estate belonging to Elizabeth’s cousin, “Long” Sir Thomas Robinson),
also a house in Dover Street, London.

    [226] For other particulars as to the Montagu family the reader is
    referred to the pedigree.

    [227] In 1689 Mr. Rogers bought the estate of East Denton,
    Northumberland, with its collieries, for £10,900.

    [228] Elizabeth Carter, born 1716, died 1806. The learned Greek
    scholar.

[Page heading: MRS. DONNELLAN’S ADVICE]

[Page heading: SWIFT’S YAHOOS]

Evidently the letter here inserted in Mrs. Anne Donnellan’s
handwriting, but unsigned, was an answer to an appeal of Elizabeth’s
for advice as to this courtship. Though long, I consider it so
perfectly suitable in its advice to any persons contemplating
matrimony, I give it _in extenso_--

 “I can’t enough express to you, my dear Friend, how much your
 confidence in me obliges me, as it shows me the place I hold in
 your heart. The latter part of your letter, which is what I write
 to now, is a difficulty I know how to pity, as I have experienced
 it, and yet I do not find I am at all the more capable of advising
 how to avoid it; there is a medium between encouragement and
 ill humour that is certainly right to avoid being thought to
 desire to raise a passion that one does not design to gratifie,
 or to be too apt to think one has raised a passion that must be
 discouraged, for as I think nothing is more unjust than to wish to
 make another unhappy, merely to gratifie a vanity of being known
 to be admired, so nothing is more ridiculous than to be too apt to
 fancy one has raised such a passion, and I should always choose
 to be the last that perceived it, rather than the first. I have
 seen so many appearances of liking that has proved neither uneasy
 to one side or t’other, that I am not apt to fear great hurt from
 them, and I fancy the longer you live the more you will be of my
 mind; indeed when a man gives way to a passion on a prospect of
 success, and finds a disappointment to it, has often, I believe,
 given a melancholy turn to his whole life: but for what I call
 occasional likings they can run from one to another with great
 ease and dexterity. Now what I think the most difficult in these
 affairs is to satisfie others in our conduct, for there is as you
 observe, in the heart of male and female a principle of vanity and
 self-love that makes us unwillingly give way to a preference in
 any thing, and we are very apt to comfort ourselves with thinking,
 and sometimes saying, that the preference given is not from greater
 perfections, but from greater encouragement, ‘some people set
 themselves out, and pay a court I cannot,’ when we are all doing
 our best to gain this descried admiration, and vexed, even to make
 us unjust when we fail. In short, and when I view human nature in
 some lights, I can almost forgive Swift’s Yahoos. But to the point.
 I should think the behaviour on these occasions should be as easy
 as we can, and we should be pretty sure there is a passion growing
 in the heart before we make an alteration that can be perceived
 by the person concerned, and as for the by-slanderers, I should
 endeavour to convince them I did not desire such a conquest, but
 at the same time, I would not let them think they could easily
 persuade me I had made it. I would converse as usual in public, but
 I would avoid private conversations, lest others should think I
 sought them, but these are things I am sure you can think of better
 than I can, and must be practised as circumstances suit. The person
 said nothing here but what was extremely proper, we talked of you
 all, and you and another were commended with great elegance, and
 for the third they said they did not know them enough to give an
 opinion.

 “Now my dear Friend a word about the desire that is natural in most
 females to make lovers, if you meet with a person who you think
 would be proper to make you happy in the married state, and they
 show a desire to please you, and a solidity in their liking, give
 it the proper encouragement that the decency of our sex will allow
 of, for it is the settlement in the world we should aim at, and
 the only way we females have of making ourselves of use to Society
 and raising ourselves in this world; but for lovers merely for
 being courted and admired they are of no real use, and often prove
 a great detriment both by their own malice of disappointment and
 their jealousy of others, and for a friendship of any tenderness
 between disengaged persons of different sexes I am afraid there
 is no such thing, so do not be caught by that deceitful bait.
 Esteem and regard may be without passion, but tenderness and
 confidence, and what we call friendship among ourselves, will, with
 opportunity, turn to desire in the different sexes. We desire to
 possess a friend to know their heart, to be in their thoughts, this
 must turn to passion between the sexes, I think ’tis impossible to
 be otherwise, and I could express it more philosophically but you
 will do it for me. Now pardon me this impertinent letter, there
 are not those in the world to whom I would write so freely, for I
 do not know those who I think have sense and goodness of heart, to
 bear advice: the only merit of mine is its sincerity and affection,
 and having seen more years has given me many opportunities of
 seeing the world of love, with all its mischiefs. Adieu, burn this,
 and love me as I do you most sincerely.

 “P.S.--I will say no more of Books till we meet, though I must
 wonder at the want of discernment in those who can read an Author
 who is all fiction, and take it for certain truth.”

[Page heading: MRS. MONTAGU’S MARRIAGE]

Anyhow, Mr. Montagu and Elizabeth entered into an engagement, and
in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for August, 1742, is the following
announcement:--“August 5th. Edward Montagu, Esqr., Member for
Huntingdon, to the eldest daughter of Matthew Robinson, of Horton in
Kent, Esqr.”

The Rev. William Freind tied the nuptial knot.

The day after her marriage Mrs. Montagu writes to the Duchess of
Portland--

  “Friday, August 6, 1742.

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “I return your Grace a thousand thanks for your letter; the good
 wishes of a friend are of themselves a happiness, and believe me I
 have always thought myself the nearer being happy because I knew
 you wished me so. If your affection to me will last as long as
 my love and gratitude towards you, I think it will stay with me
 till the latest moment I shall have in this world; no alteration
 of circumstances or length of time can wear out my grateful
 remembrance of your favours to me; you have a station in my heart,
 from whence you cannot be driven while any one virtue lives in it:
 truth, constancy, gratitude, and every honest affection guard you
 there!

 “Mr. Montagu desires me to make his compliments to my Lord Duke
 and your Grace, with many thanks for the favour his Grace designs
 him of a visit which he is not willing to put off so long as our
 return from Yorkshire, but will be glad of the honour of seeing the
 Duke on Monday, at seven o’clock in Dover Street; and I hope at
 that most happy hour to have the pleasure of seeing you. We shall
 spend that evening in Town. If you will be at home to-morrow at two
 o’clock, I will pass an hour with you; but pray send me word to
 Jermyn Street at eleven, whether I can come to you without meeting
 any person at Whitehall but the Duke; to every one else pray deny
 your dressing room. Mr. Freind will tell your Grace I behaved
 magnanimously, and not one cowardly tear, I assure you, did I shed
 at the solemn Altar, my mind was in no mirthful mood indeed. I have
 a great hope of happiness; the world, as you say, speaks well of
 Mr. Montagu, and I have many obligations to him, which must gain my
 particular esteem; but such a change of life must furnish me with a
 thousand anxious thoughts.

 “Adieu, my dear Lady Duchess: whatever I am, I must still be with
 gratitude, affection, and fidelity,

  “Yours,
  “ELIZA MONTAGU.”

[Page heading: LADY ANDOVER]

Amongst the numerous congratulations received on her marriage may
be mentioned letters from Lady Andover, staying at Levens with the
Berkshires, and Mrs. Pendarves, who writes from Calwich. The following
paragraph shows the general esteem of Mr. Montagu’s character--

 “I think you cannot be disappointed in the choice you have made;
 you know the essentials of happiness, and have made your choice
 accordingly, and Mr. Montagu must be much envied now, as he has
 always been esteemed: nobody’s character answers more to your
 merit. You must give me leave to trouble you with my compliments
 to him, and to add that I wish to be acquainted with him. I cannot
 help having a very favourable opinion of the person whom you have
 preferred to all others.”

[Page heading: “DELIA”]

“Delia” (Miss Dashwood) writes--

 “My heart in plain sincerity wishes you joy and lasting happiness,
 and sure you have the best security for both, as all allow Mr.
 Montagu has an uncommon good understanding, and as large a share of
 good nature, both which are conspicuous in yourself, that they must
 undoubtedly when joined produce a lasting harmony.”

[Page heading: HONEYMOON TOUR]

Mr. Montagu appears to have been only known by popular report to
the Bullstrode circle, till his marriage, but his immense circle of
relations and friends opened a fresh vista of delightful and extended
social engagements for his wife. This first letter of Elizabeth’s to
her mother after marriage is interesting--

  “Dover Street, August 10.

  “HOND. MADAM,

 “I had the pleasure of meeting your letter here last night at my
 arrival. The Duke and Duchess of Portland spent the evening and
 supped with us. This morning I have been looking over the house,
 and seeing many things much better than I deserve, in which I am
 to have a share: but what gives me infinitely more pleasure than
 these favours of fortune, is observing the willingness and gladness
 with which Mr. Montagu bestows them upon me. I find the house very
 good and convenient, and I hope I shall spend many happy days in
 it. Happy I am sure they will be to me, if I can make them so to
 the person who has thus obliged me. I must write but a very short
 letter, for Mrs. Medows[229] who favours us with her company to
 dinner is waiting for me in the next room.

 “My sister is just returned from some business she has been doing
 for me, she would desire her duty if she was here, but there are
 two pair of stairs between us. I hope you got well home from
 Canterbury. We propose going away on Thursday. This day we shall
 spend in Town, to-morrow we return to our Box in Kentish Town, and
 then away to Yorkshire, where if you have any commands, pray let me
 have the pleasure of executing them. Madam Sally and I will write
 our travels as we go. Mr. Montagu desires his best respects to you,
 my Father and my brothers. My duty and love attends them as proper.
 I will in all good say as far and as much for my sister as myself,
 so accept the same compliment from her, and believe me, dear Madam,
 with a grateful sense of all your and my Father’s goodness and care,

  “Your dutiful, affectionate and
  obliged Daughter,
  “ELIZA MONTAGU.

 “P.S.--I design to write to my Father next post. The Duke of
 Argyll[230] is said to be relenting upon the subject of places of
 which several are spoken of for him, and that he goes to Flanders.
 Some report that his eldest daughter[231] is to be Duchess of
 Greenwich at his death.”

It will be seen by this letter that Sarah Robinson was acting
chaperone, which the odd etiquette of those days exacted, it being then
not thought _bon ton_ for a newly married couple to be alone on their
honeymoon!

[Page heading: MR. ROBINSON]

The following letter from Mr. Robinson to his new son-in-law shows the
happiness of the newly married couple:--

  “DEAR SIR,

 “Don’t be apprehensive upon seeing this, that added to the
 impertinence you have already received from my hands, you are to
 have that of a troublesome correspondent; I can assure you it is
 the way I am the least troublesome to my friends; the truth of the
 matter is that I know I should never forgive myself if I should be
 wanting to you in any respect, even though it should amount to no
 more than a point of ceremony. As I think that no letters that come
 from your wife ought to be a secret to you, I cannot help telling
 you I saw one from her last week to her Mother, and another to her
 brother Tom, so full of the happiness of her present condition,
 and the prospect of her future, that I begin to be suspicious that
 they are designed as a reproof to me for the deplorable state under
 which she passed twenty-three years. I shall not forgive her till
 I know she uses all her endeavours to give to you an equal share,
 which I think you have at least a right to. We hope you enjoy the
 benefit of this fine weather upon the road, and will arrive safe
 and well at Allerthorpe before this to the satisfaction of my good
 friend Mr. Carter.[232] Our compliments attend your family and his.

  “I am your most obedient Servant,
  “MATT. ROBINSON.

  “Horton, August ye 15, 1742.”

This was addressed--

  “To Edward Montagu, Esqr.,

  “Yorkshire.

“Member of Parliament.”

    [232] Mr. Carter was steward and agent to Mr. Montagu; a most
    worthy man.

    [233] Allerthorpe, being close to Burneston, the Robinsons were
    well acquainted with the neighbourhood.

[Page heading: DR. CONYERS MIDDLETON]

The following letter of Dr. Conyers Middleton to Elizabeth on her
marriage is of interest:--

  “Hildersham,[234] near Linton, August 17, 1742.

  “MADAM,

 “I should have paid my compliments earlier on the joyful occasion
 of your marriage if I had known whither to address them; for your
 brother’s letter which informed me, happened to lie several days at
 Cambridge, before it came to my hands. My congratulation, however,
 though late, wants nothing of the warmth with which the earliest
 was accompanied; for I must beg leave to assure you that I take a
 real part in the present joy of your family, and feel a kind of
 paternal[235] pleasure, from the good fortune of one whose amiable
 qualities I have been a witness of from her tenderest years, and
 to whom I have ever been wishing and ominating everything that
 is good. I have always expected from your singular merit and
 accomplishments that they would recommend you in proper time to
 an advantageous and honourable match; and was assured from your
 prudence that it would never suffer you to accept any which was
 not worthy of you; so that it gives me not only the greatest
 pleasure on your account, but a sort of pride also on my own,
 to see my expectations so fully answered, and my predictions of
 you so literally fulfilled. As all conjugal happiness is founded
 on mutual affection, cherished by good sense, so you have the
 fairest prospect of it now open before you, by your marriage with a
 gentleman, not only of figure and fortune, but of great knowledge
 and understanding, who values you, not so much for the charms of
 your person, as the beauties of your mind, which will always give
 you the surest hold of him, as they will every day be gathering
 strength, whilst the others are daily losing it. But I should make
 a sad compliment to a blooming bride if I meant to exclude her
 person from contributing any part to her nuptial happiness; that is
 far from my meaning; and yours Madam, I am sure, could not fail of
 having its full share in acquiring your husband’s affection. What
 I would inculcate therefore, is only this: that though beauty has
 the greatest force to conciliate affection, yet it cannot preserve
 it without the help of the mind; and whatever the perfection of
 the one may be, the accomplishments of the other will always be
 the more amiable; and in the married state especially, will be
 found after all, the most solid and lasting basis of domestic
 comfort. But I am using the privilege of my years, and instead
 of compliments, giving lessons to one who does not want them. I
 shall only add, therefore, my repeated wishes for all the joy that
 matrimony can give you and Mr. Montagu, to whose worthy character I
 am no stranger, though I have not the honour to be known to him in
 person, and am with sincere respect,

  “Madam,
  “Your faithful friend,
  and obedient servant,
  “CONYERS MIDDLETON.

 “P.S.--My wife charges me with her compliments and best wishes of
 all happiness and prosperity in your new state of life.”

    Gray was a constant visitor there.

    [235] It will be remembered Dr. Middleton’s first wife was Mrs.
    Drake, _née_ Morris, Elizabeth’s maternal grandmother.

[Page heading: ALLERTHORPE]

Here I make some extracts from Mrs. Montagu’s second letter to her
beloved Duchess of Portland, dated August 21, 1742, from Allerthorpe,
Mr. Montagu’s Yorkshire seat--

 “On Tuesday I arrived at this place, not tired with my journey,
 but satisfied therewith. As far as Nottingham you will travel
 very soon, and then as far as Doncaster, therefore it will be
 but impertinent to give you an account of the road or anything
 concerning it. I will only tell your Grace I saw Nottingham
 Castle,[236] where there is beauty and magnificence worthy the
 wisdom and the riches of your ancestors. As we came nearer to this
 place, the country grew more wild, but not less beautiful; we came
 through some rivers that charmed me beyond all things.... We have
 at present very fine weather, the sun gilds every object, and I
 assure you it is the only fine thing we have here, for the house
 is old and not handsome: it is very convenient, and the situation
 extremely pleasant. We found the finest peaches, nectarines and
 apricots, that I have ever eat: your Grace will think I mean
 turnips, carrots and parsnips; but really and truly they are
 apricots, peaches and nectarines. To-morrow, I believe will be one
 of the happiest days I ever spent, I am to go to fetch my brothers
 from school. How delightful will be such a meeting after so many
 years’ separation.”

[Page heading: LITTLE BROTHERS]

These were her three youngest brothers, William, John, and Charles,
who had been five years at school at Scorton, without coming home. Mr.
Montagu, eager to gratify his bride’s love of her family, had allowed
her to have them to stay, and ever afterwards he was their constant
friend and benefactor. Further on in the letter she states that it took
them “six days with very easy stages” to reach Allerthorpe from London!
In the next letter she states that her little brothers being “sensible,
good-natured, and sober, the most affectionate towards each other of
any children of their age I ever saw: they have very good characters at
school, both as to their learning and behaviour; but the quintessence
of perfection is my brother Jack.”

At the end of this letter she mentions her old friend, Miss Cally
Scott, of Scott’s Hall, was going to be married to Mr. Best, a man of
fortune.

[Page heading: THE REV. MATTHEW ROBINSON]

On August 25 she writes to her cousin, Mrs. Freind--

 “Dear Cousin, I am ashamed I have not before answered your
 kind letter and returned thanks for those good wishes of whose
 accomplishments I hope there is the fairest prospect: I think we
 increase in esteem without decaying in complaisance, and I hope
 we shall always remember Mr. Freind and the fifth of August with
 thankfulness. I am infinitely obliged to Mr. Freind for not letting
 the knot be tied by the hands of an ordinary bungler; he was very
 good in coming to London on purpose, but he did not give his last
 benediction, but stole away before my sister or any of us were come
 downstairs.

 “We arrived at this place after a journey of six days through fine
 countries, where the riches of Harvest promised luxury to the
 Landlord, plenty to the farmer and food to the labourer. Here we
 are situated in a fine country, and Mr. Montagu has the pleasure
 of calling many hundred pounds a year about his house his own,
 without any person’s property interfering with it: I think it is
 the prettiest estate, and in the best order I ever saw; large
 and beautiful meadows for riding or walking in, with a pretty
 river[237] winding about them, upon which we shall sometimes go out
 in boats.

 “In this parish Dr. Robinson,[238] our general Uncle, has founded a
 school and an Alms House where the young are taught industry, the
 old, content: I propose to visit the Alms House very soon. I saw
 the old women with the Bucks upon their sleeves at Church, and it
 gave me pleasure. Heraldry[239] does not always descend with such
 honour, as when Charity leads her by the hand. Our uncle did this
 good while he was _alive_; it was not that Soul thrift that would
 save itself with another’s money.

 “I hope you will forgive my not having written to you before, but a
 new family, and a new place must take up one’s time. Our house here
 is tolerably convenient, and that is all that can be said for it.
 We have a better which I hope you will often see in Berkshire.[240]
 Pray when you and Mr. Freind have a leisure hour, dispose of it in
 writing to me. Mr. Montagu has an estate near Rokeby, from whence
 I intend to visit Sir Thomas Robinson’s[241] fine park of which I
 hear great praising.

  “I am, dear Madam,
  “Your most affectionate cousin,
  and obedient, humble servant,
  “ELIZABETH MONTAGU.”

[Page heading: FIRST LETTER TO MR. MONTAGU]

Mr. Montagu having left Elizabeth for a few days for business at
Newcastle, she writes to him--

 “How very fortunate are those few who in the Person they love, meet
 with the principles of Honour and Virtue to guide them through
 the World, but this, my fortune, so happy and so rare, shall not
 breed in me that insolence of opinion that I deserve it, but I
 will still look up to Heaven and you with gratitude and continual
 acknowledgments.”

This sufficiently indicates the happiness and mutual confidence
reigning between the newly wedded pair.

On October 2 Dr. Conyers Middleton wrote Mrs. Montagu a long letter,
mainly a dissertation on marriage and its duties. He alludes to his
pleasure at her having her three youngest brothers with her, calling
them “_enfans trouvés_ by a sister unknown to them,” and he adds--

 “I shall always think myself particularly interested in their
 success, for they were all born under my roof, which may, one day
 perhaps, derive an accession of fame from that circumstance. If I
 should live to see any of them in the University, it would be a
 pleasure to me to do everything in my power that might be of use to
 their improvement.”

This shows that Mrs. Robinson had been accustomed to stay with her
mother, the first Mrs. Middleton, for her latter frequent confinements,
though Elizabeth and some of the elder sons were born at York. Dr.
Middleton begs Mr. and Mrs. Montagu to pay him a visit at Cambridge on
their return to London, and states, “This university had the honour of
Mr. Montagu’s education, and claims some share in yours.”

[Page heading: PÈRE LE COURAYER]

[Page heading: WORKSOP]

Being detained by business in the north, Mrs. Montagu wrote to Mrs.
Donnellan to send her a winter mantle and muff, and as prices of those
times may interest my readers, I will mention the blue velvet mantle
cost £5, the ermine muff one guinea. In Mrs. Donnellan’s letter the
Père Courayer sends his compliments and good wishes to Mrs. Montagu.
As he figures much in later letters, I give a short sketch of his
biography. Peter Francis le Courayer was born in 1681, and was a
Normandy ecclesiastic; although a Roman Catholic, he had the courage
to defend the ordinances of the English Church, for which the Pope
censured him severely. He left France for England, and went to Oxford,
where he lodged with Mrs. Chenevix, the famous toy-woman. He was made
LL.D., and translated Father Paul’s “History of the Council of Trent,”
also Sleidan’s “History of the Reformation.” He was well known to
Horace Walpole. He died in 1776. His pet-name was “the little Père.”
In a letter of the duchess’s of October 9 from Welbeck, where she was
visiting her mother, Lady Oxford, she says--

 “Mamma was so obliging last week as to carry us to Worksop
 Manor,[242] the Duke of Norfolk’s.[243] The Designs are noble
 and grand, they have made great plantations. The gardener told
 me he had planted last year 300,000 Forest trees, besides sowing
 three score bushels of seeds. The approach to the house is fine.
 I don’t like the house though it was built by Bess of Harwicke,
 whose wisdom I have in great reverence: the best apartment is
 up two pair of stairs, the additional offices lately built are
 exceedingly good, the Dairy much prettier than that we saw at
 Richmond. The servant told us the Duchess gave the chief direction
 for the building, had planted those woods, had drawn the plan
 for that piece of water of 120 acres. The Duke’s time is chiefly
 occupied with drawing plans for Bee hives! With difficulty I kept
 my countenance....

    [242] Worksop was burnt down in 1761. The duke here mentioned built
    500 rooms to it.

    [243] Edward Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk.

[Page heading: FRENCH ECONOMY]

“We were on Monday at Kiveton, which is by much the finest house I
ever saw, and the best furnished. The Park and views from it are very
beautiful.”

From Allerthorpe the Montagus visited Mr. Buckley[244] at Bishop’s
Dale, near which place Mr. Robinson in former days had lived in the
shooting season. Elizabeth had not been there for fifteen years. She
describes to the Duchess of Portland the country--

    [244] Mr. Buckley had been a second father to the three little
    Robinson boys, who spent their holidays with him.

 “I had been three days upon an expedition to a wild part of the
 country called the Dales, where Nature’s works are not delicate,
 pretty and mignonne, but grand, sublime and magnificent. Vast
 mountains, rocks and cascades, and rapid rivers make the country
 beautiful and surprising. We went to a farm abounding in wonders, a
 high hill with some hanging wood before it, behind it a large and
 rapid river with the prospect of a huge cascade, an old Castle and
 a Church. Some houses in view take from it the honour of absolute
 solitude: a range of rocks appears like the ruins of an old town on
 the other side of the river. In a cottage built in this charming
 place, lives an old woman, who has attained to an hundred and
 four years, and for this long lease of life, has not exchanged
 the best comfort. She enjoys good health, tolerable strength, has
 her hearing perfect, and her sight very well: is cheerful and has
 not lost her reason, but answers with sense and spirit, her hair
 is of a fine black: she was knitting when we went to her, and has
 promised to knit me a pair of stockings in a month.

 “My Father had a house in this part of the world for the summer
 sports of shooting and fishing, so that the old woman and I had
 been well acquainted 15 years ago, and she told me laughing she
 imagined I did not expect to see her alive at this time....

 “Tell Père Courayer[245] my head is as much troubled with chimeras
 and giddiness as ever. I fear he is too fond of variety in life to
 be a friend to Matrimony. The merriest man I have seen in Yorkshire
 is a Frenchman, who came here for religion, and has had the needful
 of life added unto him; he has a little estate, and lives with
 the mountain nymphs, Liberty and Health, in the Dales; he amuses
 himself with singing to his grandchildren, mending his clothes,
 and making soup: his grandson eats soup with him, and his next
 darling, _le petit chat_, helps him off with the Bouillie. He can
 not only make a fine dish of the cabbage, but of the snails and
 caterpillars, and what we call the unprofitable vermin that live
 upon it! There was not a creature in Noah’s Ark that would not be
 received into his larder, for a Frenchman is seldom so proud of
 stomach as to term anything unclean....

 “Mr. Montagu desires his compliments to your grace, and my Lord
 Duke; we talk of you and drink your health as often as you can
 expect from sober people. Had I married a Tory fox-hunter he might
 have toasted you in a longer draught; but for temperate Whigs we do
 you reason.

  “I am, my dear Lady Duchess’s
  most grateful, and most affectionate,
  “E. MONTAGU.”

    [245] He had expressed a fear that matrimony would spoil her
    philosophy.

[Page heading: WHIG PRINCIPLES]

Mr. Montagu was a Whig, but, as his wife states, a moderate one. His
political conduct as Member for Huntingdon was irreproachably upright
in a most venal age. What respect his wife already had for his judgment
is shown in a letter from her to him in London, whither he had gone for
the meeting of Parliament on October 16, enclosing her reply to Dr.
Conyers Middleton’s letter, desiring him, if he did not approve of it,
to burn it, and she would write another. The following passage speaks
volumes for Mrs. Montagu’s humility (though she was so universally
praised):--

 “The letter directed to Dr. Middleton, if you approve, I would beg
 the favour of you to frank, and send to the post, but I should
 be glad if you would first take the trouble to read it, for it
 is with some uneasiness I correspond with the very wise. I think
 an understanding of a middle size has a great deal of trouble in
 conversation between reaching to those above it, and stooping to
 those below it.” She signs--

  “My Dearest, your very affectionate
  and faithful wife.”

His letters to her begin generally “My Dearest Angel,” or “My Dearest
Life.” His writing is most characteristic, a clear, firm hand, easily
read, much information compressed into a few words, and filled with
most affectionate expressions.

Elizabeth was now in an interesting condition, and as Dr. Sandys
forbade her travelling for a time, she and Sarah remained at
Allerthorpe. The joy of Mr. Montagu was extreme at the idea of an heir,
which was shared by his sister, Mrs. Medows, and all his relations.
Elizabeth, though pleased at the prospect, was very _souffrante_, and
bored by an inactive life, yet submitted to it with a good grace.

At this period her brother Robert was made captain of an East India
vessel travelling to China, to his family’s satisfaction.

[Page heading: DR. MEAD]

The Duchess of Portland writes from London and says--

 “I was extremely well entertained the other day with seeing
 Dr. Mead’s[246] curiosities. They are much finer than Sir Hans
 Sloane’s. In particular he has a mummy much finer preserved. It
 is the custom to gild their faces, so that all the features are
 painted over the gold.... Of all the things, except the pictures,
 which are exquisitely fine, none pleases me more than a mask in
 bronze, which is exceeding fine workmanship, and has upon it the
 symbols of all the gods. The crown of vine for Bacchus, a circle
 of iron for Pluto, the ears of Pan, and the beard of waves for
 Neptune.”

    [246] Dr. Richard Mead, born 1673, died 1754. Celebrated physician
    and antiquarian.

We gain a peep at French fashions of the day in this paragraph, in a
letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s--

 “Mrs. Rook, an acquaintance of mine, is just come from Paris, and
 is come without a hoop, and tells me, except in their high dress,
 nobody wears one. Their sacks are made proportionably narrow and
 short, opened before with a petticoat and trimmed, and with a stiff
 quilted petticoat under: the only reasonable thing I have heard
 from France a great while, and the only fashion I should wish to
 follow.”

[Page heading: THE MUFF]

[Page heading: THE HANOVER TROOPS]

It would be impossible to include in this work all the letters between
Mr. Montagu and his wife, but the following shall be given in its
entirety to show his style:--

  “November, 1742.

  “MY DEAREST LIFE,

 “Yesterday as soon as it came to hand, j[247] sent yours to my
 sister. I have not seen her but am sure she thinks herself much
 obliged, as all must do who have the happiness of a correspondence
 with you, whose letters not only please by their wit and vivacity,
 but are full of sincerity and friendship, of virtue and goodness,
 which you set in so true and amiable a light, that if those that
 read them grow not wiser and better, it is none of your fault.

 “I rejoice at the good account you give of your health, that
 you suffer less and less every day. I wish j could prevent your
 suffering at all. The prudent care you take obliges me in the
 highest degree, and j hope with the assistance of your happy and
 chearful disposition of mind, preserve you from any misfortune.
 Though j most eagerly long to see you, j would have you run no
 hazard, and will content myself till we break up, when j hope
 neither bad roads nor bad weather shall hinder me coming to you:
 till then j desire you to spend your time as agreeably as you can,
 and am glad Mrs. Yorke and Mrs. Clayton are to make you a visit.

 “I waited on Mrs. Donnellan this morning, yesterday was not
 convenient for her, and could not do it before. I paid her the bill
 which j send enclos’d and a guinea more for your muffe, so that out
 of ye six guineas j shall owe you five shillings. She expressed
 herself much obliged, and desired her compliments to you, and both
 to you and Miss Salley.

 “Your Father went out of Town last Friday. The evening before j
 spent with him, Dr. Audley and your three brothers,[248] who were
 all well. I suppose you will soon have your instructions about
 your children[249] at Scorton. You do well in letting them take
 leave of those they are so much obliged to, and when they come from
 Burton, if they spend the rest of their time with you, there will
 be no harm in it, nor will it hinder them in their learning, as
 they are designed for another school.

 “My good friend at Theakstone[250] sent me his brother’s letter,
 and j received another this afternoon from the Admiralty Office,
 which j will send you in a post or two, that you may communicate it
 to his relations. I shall do all j can to serve him, and after j
 have made inquiry about the manner of doing it, will write to his
 Father.

 “On Thursday last a motion was made for a secret Committee, and the
 next day for the place Bill, both which succeeded as was expected,
 the first was flung out by a majority of 66, the latter by a
 majority of 25! The Debates were very warm, and the Chancellor of
 the Exchequer[251] was terribly roasted, but all to no purpose,
 for after what has happened, he and such as he, who have acted so
 perfidious a part, will be sure to go all lengths. On Monday we
 expect to have the consideration of the 16,000 Hanover troops[252]
 come before us, and to be carried through, a worse thing than any
 that was ever attempted in the time of Sir R(obert) W(alpole).

 “I hope this will find dear Miss Salley recovered, pray present her
 with my best compliments, and believe me to be,

 “With the most tender regard,

  “My Dearest’s most obliged and
  affectionate Husband,
  “EDW. MONTAGU.”

    [247] Mr. Montagu, like the Duke of Portland, for years used “j”
    for “I,” presumably an old custom.

    [248] Matthew, Thomas, and Morris.

    [249] Her three youngest brothers, John, William, and Charles.

    [250] Young Mr. Edward Carter, son of Mr. Montagu’s head agent.
    He was petitioning for his brother, Mr. William Carter, to have a
    company of Marines, he being in that service through Mr. Montagu’s
    influence.

    [251] Mr. Sandys.

    [252] These men to receive British pay.

[Page heading: ORATORIOS]

Mrs. Montagu writes to the Duchess of Portland--

 “I am now in the highest content: my little brothers are to go to
 Westminster, as soon as the holidays are over, and what adds still
 to my pleasure in this, is that Jacky’s going is owing to Mr.
 Montagu’s intercession for him with my Father, who did not design
 his going to Westminster till next year: our youngest,[253] I
 believe, is to go out with our new Captain....

 “I am pretty well, but I do not like to sit still like Puss in the
 corner all the winter to watch what may prove a mouse, though I am
 no mountain. I cannot boast of the numbers that adorn our fireside,
 my sister and I are the principal figures; besides there is a
 round table, a square screen, some books and a work basket, with a
 smelling bottle, when morality grows musty, or a maxim smells too
 strong, as sometimes they will in ancient books.

 “I had a letter to-day from Mr. Montagu, in which he flatters me
 with the hopes of seeing him at Christmas.”

    [253] Charles to accompany his brother Robert.

In a letter of Mrs. Pendarves of December 9 from Clarges Street,
where she was living, she tells Mrs. Montagu, “Handel is to have six
oratorios in Lent. The operas are dull, the plays for one part well
acted, ten are wretched, but Garrick is excellent.”

About this time Elizabeth writes a long letter to the Rev. William
Freind, her cousin, portions of which I give. She says--

 “The last and best good office you did me, I believe, will claim
 my thanks to the longest day of my life.... I know it will please
 you to hear that I have, every day since you made me a wife, had
 more reason to thank you for the alteration. I have the honour
 and happiness to be made the guest of a heart furnished with the
 best and greatest virtues, honesty, integrity and universal
 benevolence, with the most engaging affection to every one who
 particularly belongs to him. No desire of power, but to do good,
 no use of it but to make happy. I cannot be so unjustly diffident
 as to doubt of the duration of my happiness, when I see the author
 of it dispensing content to all his dependants, and should he ever
 cease to use me with more care and generosity and affection than I
 deserve, I should be the first person he has ever treated in this
 manner. Since I married I have never heard him say an ill-natured
 word to any one, or have I received one matrimonial frown. His
 generous affection in loving all my friends, and desiring every
 opportunity for my conversing with them, is very obliging to me.
 We have often pleased ourselves with the hopes of seeing you
 frequently in Dover Street this winter; but alas, I am a prisoner
 at Allerthorpe, and the worst of prisoners confined by infirmities
 and ill health.

 “Mr. Montagu went to Parliament ten days ago to my mortification,
 but with my approbation. I desired him to go, and half wished
 him to stay! I knew his righteous star would rule his destiny,
 so I helped him on with honour’s boots, and let him go without
 murmuring. He left me my sister, and where she is there will
 happiness be also.... We have not been troubled with any visitor
 since Mr. M. went away, and could you see how ignorant, how
 awkward, how absurd, and how uncouth the generality of people
 are in this country, you would look upon this as a piece of good
 fortune....

 “I am very happy in one thing, that drinking is not within our
 walls; we have not had one person disordered by liquor since we
 came down, though most of the poor ladies have had more Hogs in
 their dining rooms than ever they had in their hog stye....

 “I imagine you will have seen Dr. Middleton’s translations of the
 Epistle by this time; pray tell me what you think of them.”

[Page heading: “NIGHT THOUGHTS”]

The Duchess of Portland, on December 4, writes in great annoyance at
some of her letters being lost. She was much worried about the health
of her mother, who suffered severely from cramp in the stomach. She
desires Elizabeth to write a _visible_[254] letter to cheer Lady
Oxford, and adds, “I rejoice you are better. I hope you have left off
footing it and tumbling downstairs. Have you read ‘Night Thoughts’? If
you have, I beg you will give me your opinion of it.”

    [254] Often the familiar letters were enclosed to Mrs. Elstob, a
    learned lady and authoress, who was now governess to the Portland
    children. Lady Oxford was then at Bullstrode.

Dr. Young had lost his beloved wife, his step-son and step-daughter
the year before. The step-daughter died of consumption, brought on by
grief at her mother’s loss. Her step-father had taken her abroad for
her health. She died at Montpellier, and was refused Christian burial
by the bigoted French of those days. The poor doctor, assisted by his
servant, dug her grave in a field, unaided by any one. Can any one
wonder at the gloom pervading the poem?

Whilst the duchess is writing to Mrs. Montagu, the latter writes on
December 5--

 “Madam, after being sunk into stupidity by the company of a strange
 kind of animal called a country Beau and wit, how unfit am I for
 conversation of the Duchess of Portland!”

[Page heading: A ROUÉ OF THE PERIOD]

She then proceeds to draw this curious picture of a country beau,--

 “who cannot attain the perfection of a monkey, even the art of
 mimicry.... Had you seen the pains this animal has been taking to
 imitate the cringe of a beau, the smartness of a wit, till he was
 hideous to behold, and horrible to hear, you would have pitied
 him! He walks like a tortoise, and chatters like a magpye: by
 the indulgence of a kind mother, and the advantage of a country
 education, he was first a clown, then he was sent to the Inns
 of Court, where he first fell into a red waistcoat and velvet
 breeches; then into vanity. This light companion led him to the
 play house, where he ostentiously coquetted with the orange
 wenches, who cured him of the bel-air of taking snuff by abridging
 him of his nostrils, grown even in his own eyes no very lovely
 figure; he thought Bacchus, no critic in faces, would prove in
 the end a better friend than Cupid: accordingly he fell into the
 company of the jovial, till want of money and want of taste led
 this prodigal son, if not to eat, to drink with swine. He visited
 the prisons, not as a comforter, but as a companion to criminals;
 shook hands with the gold finder, and walked in the ways of the
 scavenger; so singular his humility, none were his contempt. At
 last, having lost his money, ruined his constitution, and lost all
 the sense nature gave him, he returned to the country where all the
 youths of inferior rank, admiring his experience, and emulating his
 qualities, and copying his manners, grew, some fit for jail, others
 for transportation.... Notwithstanding all these vices and the most
 nauseous effect of them, all people treat him civilly!”

Mr. Montagu writes to his wife on December 9,[255] and in it he says--

 “Tomorrow the affair of the Hanover troops[256] comes on, and will
 be carried, which is the worst that ever came before the House,
 of which j shall give you an account in my next letter, and send
 you several pamphlets well worth your reading about that, and the
 present state of affairs.”

Writing again from his house in Dover Street, London, on December 20,
he says--

 “On Tuesday we met at Westminster, where his Majesty opened the
 session with a most gracious speech from the throne, which j hope
 you have got, as you shall have the addresses of both Houses sent
 by this post. You will easily perceive what was aimed at by the
 speech, and that by the addresses both the Lords and Commons have
 most dutifully consented to take 16,000 Hanover troops into our
 pay. This was openly avowed by Lord Carteret[257] in the Upper
 House, and by those who made the motion in the Lower. After a
 debate which lasted till between 10 and 11 at night our address
 was carried by a majority of 109, the numbers being 150 and 259.
 By that stroke England is become a province to Hanover, the charge
 of the military part of its government already being flung upon
 us (for who shall tell when we shall get rid of this burthen?)
 or how soon we shall feel the additional part of the same? The
 late ministry never attempted anything like it, and it shows that
 the new one will stick at nothing to recommend themselves to the
 King, the Devil in Milton, ‘_with one bound, high overleapt all
 bound_.’... The number of those that love their country truly,
 always was and ever will be but small, and the Saints never yet
 governed the Earth, and I believe never will, but true patriotism
 is not the less a virtue for that, nor must its votaries leave off
 their endeavours or be discouraged at whatever happens.”

    [255] Remember this is “Old Style” date.

    [256] This was the proposal to pay Hanoverian troops with English
    money to assist in the war.

    [257] Afterwards Lord Granville, born 1690, died 1763. Secretary of
    State.

It will hardly be credited that the country apothecary bled Mrs.
Montagu for a headache in her delicate condition; but so he did, and as
a fever was then raging, she submitted, though saying she heard “he had
let the life out of the veins of eleven people,” as this disease would
not stand “blooding!”

[Page heading: A BOLUS!]

A Mr. Twycross, who was in love with Sarah Robinson, suffered from sore
throat, and she accordingly herself made up a bolus for him from a
recipe of an old maid friend, the size of which alarmed Mrs. Montagu.
Fortunately, his throat getting better, he did not use it, to Mrs.
Montagu’s relief, who says--

 “Had he swallowed it I should have thought there was love powder
 in it, for he said a thousand pretty things to her, with an air of
 great tenderness, and indeed had he taken the bolus I believe no
 man could have been nearer dying for a lady. The recipe had been
 given her by an ancient maiden, who having said in her sorrow all
 men were liars, thought the best way to cure them of the vice of
 telling lyes was to choak them.”

[Page heading: A WHITSTABLE HOY]

Some details as to the conveyance of goods are given in a letter of Mr.
Robinson, Senior, to Mr. Montagu on December 12, saying, “Dear Sir, I
sent on Saturday by the Whitstable Hoy[258] ‘_Talbot_’ two brace of
woodcocks and a pheasant, which I hope you have received.”

    [258] A coasting vessel.

In a letter to Mr. Montagu, December 17, his wife desires him,

 “pray order Griffith to send me down ‘The Complaint, or Thoughts
 on Time, Death and Friendship.’[259]... I have been desired by a
 friend to read it....

 “Our boys[260] are to be put on board the York stage this day
 sennight, this will be their first launching into the world, I wish
 the bounteous Lady Fortune would take ’em in hand. Jacky is vastly
 pleased that you entreated his Father to send him to Westminster.
 They desire their best respects.”

    [260] Her three little brothers.

[Page heading: THE LORD CHANCELLOR]

Mr. Montagu was still detained in London, not only by his parliamentary
duties, but for a Chancery suit. He writes on December 21, lamenting
the long separation “from the ardent object of his desires,” but
pleased to think that the doctor will soon give her permission to join
him in London. This passage throws light on law suits of that day--

 “Our petition, as we were made to expect, was to have been heard
 this day, but the Lord Chancellor who has, j think, much more
 business than any one man can go through as he ought to do, had
 so many petitions that it is thought impossible it should come
 on sooner than tomorrow, and may not be till near the beginning
 of next term. Part of his Lordship’s time is this day taken up
 by his attendance on the King, who comes to the House of Lords
 to pass some money bills, in all his royal pageantry and show.
 Things of this nature add a great deal to the plague, expense
 and delay of Law, especially in the Court of Chancery. If we are
 not heard tomorrow in the forenoon j shall be deprived of your
 brother’s[261] assistance, who was so good as to come post from
 Canterbury on Sunday last on purpose, and must set out again for
 the same place at noon tomorrow.... This day the House of Commons
 are to be adjourned till after the hollydays, and it is talked
 that the Session will be at an end by the beginning of March. The
 opposition has been carried on with a great deal of Spirit and
 will be continued to be so after Xmas, as it is given out. They
 intend to make a new ministry wade through more mire, though they
 have gone through so much already. They have got themselves more
 enemies in the short time they have been in, than Lord Orford in
 his long reign, for they are ruining their country faster than
 ever he did, and this infamous job of the Hanoverian Troops, it’s
 thought was what he never would give way to. Several of our young
 Members have greatly distinguished themselves by their opposition,
 and made it appear that there is no want of the parts and capacity
 of those who have so perfidiously deserted them and the cause of
 liberty. But none has done it so eminently as Mr. Pit(t),[262] who
 in the opinion of several, as well as me, is a greater man than
 ever j have sat with, and if he preserves his integrity, will be
 transmitted to posterity in the most illustrious of characters. He
 is at least equal, if not superior to Mr. Murray,[263] who has been
 brought into the House on purpose to contend with him, and who did
 the first day of his entrance by saying everything the cause would
 bear in so good a manner, that he gave nobody offence, which makes
 me believe he will not serve the ministry in the slavish, dirty
 manner other attorneys and solicitor generals are wont to do, but
 with more dignity to himself, if not with more advantage to their
 cause....

 “I hope you will, along with this, receive Mr. Hervey’s
 lucubration. If Lord Shaftesbury’s ‘Characteristics’ are among my
 books, Wear shall bring them down....

 “It is with much pleasure j acquaint you Lady Sandwich[264] was on
 Saturday morning at 4 o’clock safely brought to bed of a Son.”[265]

    [261] Thomas Robinson.

    [262] William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, born 1708, died 1778; “the
    great commoner.”

    [263] William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, born 1705, died 1793.

    [264] Wife of the 4th Earl of Sandwich, cousin of Mr. Montagu’s.

    [265] John, afterwards 5th Earl of Sandwich.

In writing to the Duchess of Portland on December 28 to wish her a
happy new year, Mrs. Montagu informs her she has permission from Dr.
Sandys to move towards London in a fortnight’s time. She says--

 “I shall move as slowly as a fat corpse in a herse. Your grace asks
 me if I have left off footing and tumbling down stairs; as to the
 first, my fidgetations are much spoiled, sometimes I have cut a
 thoughtless caper which has gone to the heart of an old Steward of
 Mr. Montagu’s, who is as honest as ‘Trusty’ in the play of _Grief à
 la Mode_. I am told he has never heard a hop that he has not echoed
 with a groan. I have taken such heed to my goings I have not gone
 down stairs more than by gradual degrees.”

The following passage from a letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s to Mrs. Montagu
shows the price paid for embroidery of flowers which was much used at
this time on dresses. She says--

 “I have spoken to Jenny Clegg about your sack. She always works
 according to the price, the slightest trimming down to the bottom,
 of natural flowers she says will be £8, and the handsomest £12, and
 between in proportion. I gave her 4 guineas for my apron, and she
 has always three and a half or four for the robings and facings of
 a night dress.”

A “night dress” was what we should call an _evening dress_ now.

[Page heading: A COOK]

In a letter to Mrs. Donnellan a light is thrown on that ever-important
functionary, a cook. That individual being required, Mrs. Donnellan had
mentioned a cook who had been with Lady Selina Bathurst. Mrs. Montagu
writes--

 “As to the Cook being an Irish woman, I think it can be no
 objection to me who prefer a lady[266] of that country to almost
 any one of our own; she being a good catholick is not much, but I
 think it will not be right to take her unless Lady Selina Bathurst
 says she is a good cook, for had she all the cardinal virtues,
 and could not fricasy (_sic_) and make good soop (_sic_) I should
 not know what to do with her. I would give £15 a year to a very
 good cook, but if she is not above being improved, and I could
 get her to go into the King’s kitchen, or to any famous Tavern to
 learn cookery, I would give a guinea or two for her teaching, and
 I heard that in the places I mention they will take in a person
 upon such terms. I suppose she will dress meat on fast days? I like
 the character of the woman provided she has had the smallpox, as I
 would not have any person in the house who might run me into the
 hazard.”

    [266] Mrs. Donnellan was _Irish_.

The three Robinson boys were taken by young Mr. Edward Carter to York,
placed in the coach to London, and were met by Griffith, a valet of
Mr. Montagu’s in London, Mr. Montagu taking them in in Dover Street,
and despatching them with a servant to Canterbury, _en route_ for Mount
Morris.

[Page heading: CHANCERY SUIT]

On December 28 Mrs. Montagu writes to her husband she trusts to set
out for London on January 9, and hopes to accomplish the journey in
ten or eleven days! The Chancery suit had been deferred till January
13. A letter of Thomas Robinson’s regretting his inability to leave
the Kentish Sessions held at Maidstone contains this passage, “I have
already two or three retainers for that day, and have generally the
good fortune to be employed in every cause, which makes the gains of
the day considerable.”... He winds up with saying he has delivered his
brief of the Montagu case to Mr. Fawcet, who, he is sure, will make
better use of it than he should.

And so ends the year 1742.




CHAPTER V.

 1743–4--JOURNEY TO LONDON--LETTERS CHIEFLY FROM SANDLEFORD PRIORY,
 FROM BATH, AND FROM LONDON--THE DEATH OF HER CHILD.


[Year: 1743]

At last the longed-for day arrived for Mrs. Montagu and her sister to
set out southwards. Mr. Carter, the faithful old steward, insisted on
travelling with them instead of his son Edward, and the description
of his excitement and anxiety shown by his expressions are very
characteristic. Arrived at Doncaster on January 8, Mrs. Montagu writes
to her husband and mother, stating that she could not do so before, as
this was the first south post she had met.

[Page heading: THE FLOODS]

The letter to her mother is dated--

  “Doncaster, Saturday the 8,
  “(January).

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “I arrived here this evening, without having suffer’d any
 inconvenience or fatigue in my whole progress. We were met on
 Thursday in Leeming Lane[267] by a Messenger from Capt. Twycross to
 tell us the waters were out at Burroughbridge, and that we could
 not pass them, so I apply’d to my guide, Mr. Carter, and a wise man
 is certainly never out of his element. He told me I might go to
 Kirby Hill and there get a warm lodging, though not an elegant one;
 which he thought would be as well as turning back. For my part I
 assured him I had rather have my bed stuffed with flocks than my
 pillow with care and disappointment, and agreed to go on to the
 place he mentioned, and then send a messenger to see if the waters
 were fallen. The Dove returned with an olive branch, and we went on
 to the Waterside[268] there to prevent fear (for danger there was
 none), we got into a boat and navigated through Mr. Williamson’s
 gardens, his melancholy yews just shew’d their formal heads above
 the water. Himself a melancholy shade too, was almost in as bad
 a way, for the water was quite to his door, so he could get no
 amusement from the rest of the world, but what he saw from the
 windows. We were safely landed at the door of the Inn. The coach
 came through the water without getting any wet inside of it, and we
 all rejoiced that we had been more afraid than hurt. Mr. Carter,
 in his care, often bid me be of good courage; as there was not
 occasion for any, I could not be disgraced for want of it: from our
 first setting out I have not been less entertain’d than guarded by
 him, he has really acted the part of Sir Roger de Coverley all the
 way; his benevolent heart breaks into such honest and affectionate
 expressions, you would think he was talking to his family wherever
 he is; at the ‘Oak-tree’ he was, I saw, shaking hands with every
 creature. I stopp’d to speak to a servant of Mrs. Yorke’s who met
 us with her compliments, and could hear Mr. Carter praising the
 strong beer, thanking the Landlord, wishing many good things to
 a boy who was stuffing a luncheon of bread and butter, thanking
 Heaven for good weather, and commending the road, all in a breath.
 At Lord Castlecomer’s Inn he would stop for the horses to eat, he
 said a sort of grace to it, praying it might strengthen them to the
 end of their journey, then he extolled the Inn, the Landlord and
 his wife, not forgetting a ‘lile lass’ that stood at the gate: all
 the way we went in the boat he commended the boatmen more than an
 envious person would have done Christopher Columbus, for exploring
 leas and lands unknown; at Borough Bridge he made the funeral Elogy
 of Mr. Mann, but not to wrong the living for the sake of the dead,
 he said the handsomest things to mine Hostess, the civilest things
 to her daughters, the most honourable things of her son, and the
 most affable things to the chambermaid, that ever I heard in my
 life. At Aberforth he was not less kind to every creature, nor less
 indulgent to every thing, and he is the same still, and I doubt not
 but will be Sir Roger de Coverley to the end of the journey. I am
 really pleased by reflection, and though I don’t see everything in
 his point of view, I am delighted at his happiness, like the bee he
 gathers honey from every flower, nay, weed, which to common taste
 have no perfection. I wish I could think as well of all mankind
 as he does; but he deserves to think better of it. Benevolence is
 built so much on faith, that those who think very ill of people in
 general, will never do them much good, for service often arises
 from trust, and we cannot trust those whom we dare not believe.”

    [267] Leeming Lane, a stage 218 miles from London.

    [268] Boroughbridge is on the river Ure.

[Page heading: A FAITHFUL STEWARD]

The end of this letter is lost. Mr. Montagu being unable, from the
Chancery cause coming on, to meet his wife, despatched a servant
named Griffith, but he, falling ill at an early stage of the road,
deputed another person to meet her. A most dutiful and affectionate
letter occurs here to Mr. Montagu, but too long for inclusion. Mr.
Carter having seen them safe to Leicester, left them there, where
Sarah Robinson had an attack of illness which delayed them a day. When
well enough, they proceeded by way of Harborough, Newport Pagnell,
Dunstable, etc., to Dover Street, London.

Mrs. Freind and Mrs. Botham (Mrs. Sterne’s sister, Lydia), both
expecting their confinements, entreated Mrs. Montagu to stand godmother
to their future babes, to which she consented. Mr. Botham was then
Rector of Yoxall, Staffordshire, and Chaplain to Lord Aylesford,[269]
whose daughter Mary, Lady Andover,[270] was Mrs. Botham’s most intimate
friend and patroness. She was also a friend of Mrs. Montagu’s, to whom
she constantly wrote tidings of Lydia Botham’s frequent illnesses and
pecuniary troubles.

    [269] Heneage, 2nd Earl of Aylesford.

    [270] Wife to William, Viscount Andover, son of 11th Earl of
    Suffolk.

[Page heading: MR. ROGERS’ PEDIGREE]

The Chancery suit Mr. Montagu had been engaged in was occasioned by
his claiming the guardianship of his unfortunate first cousin, Mr.
John Rogers, who, owning large estates at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and East
and West Denton near there, besides much other property, had now been
a lunatic[271] for some years. It will be seen in the pedigree that
Mr. Montagu’s mother was a Sarah Rogers. This table will elucidate the
relationship--

[Page heading: A CURIOUS LETTER]

Old Mr. Rogers had bought East Denton land and collieries for £10,900
from the Erringtons in 1689, who had long had the property. In
December, 1705, Mr. Rogers bought of Sir James Clavering his share of
the West Denton property. The history of Denton Hall will be given
further on. Young John Rogers appears to have had fits as early as
1718. He married in 1713, Anne Delaval, who died in 1723 at Seaton
Delaval, and he seems to have become deranged soon after her death. As
long as his mother lived he was well cared for, but she died in 1733,
and the last nine years he had been gradually getting worse, and a set
of designing people surrounded him. I have a letter of his written to
his parents, apparently on going to Oxford in 1705, which is so curious
that I insert it here. It is addressed--

  “To
  “John Rogers, Esqr., att
  “The House in Newcastle upon Tyne,
  “These--”

  “DEAR FATHER,

 “I hope since that I am fallen into the hands of a gentleman, who
 is not only a stranger to you, but to all my relations, that you
 will do me the favour to write to my tutor, which I am sure he
 can’t but take exceeding well, having never heard from any of my
 friends since I removed heather. I had notice by my Mother yt you
 had ordered me £40, and wonder that as yett I have not heard from
 John Nicholson, that, I fancy Mr. Atkinson’s letter has miscarried.
 I see Mr. Fremantel here on Sunday night who sett forward for
 Newcastle on Monday morning, that I fancy you will see him before
 you receive this. We had one man executed here on Saturday morning
 who was taken here just a little before our assizes by two Smiths,
 he had been twice put in the Gazett for a highwayman, and those
 fellows took him, hoped to receive the reward. The fellow knowing
 himself to be a great rogue, and that if he escaped here, they
 would have had a Habeas Corpus to remove him, sent for the man
 whose horse it was he had stolen, to come to challenge his horse,
 and was indited for it and pleaded guilty, hoping I suppose to be
 transported. There was a great interest made at Court for to save
 his life, but all would not doo, but by this he has baulked the
 fellows yt took him of their £40.

 “So with my duty to my Mother and yourself,

  “I am, dear Father,
  “Your dutiful Son,
  “JOHN ROGERS.

  “Oxon, August 18, 1705.”

[Page heading: MR. MONTAGU’S JOURNEY]

Mr. Montagu was made guardian and manager to Mr. Rogers and his estate.
Uneasy as he was at leaving his wife in her present situation, he was
obliged to go to Newcastle to see into affairs. Sarah Robinson, who
had gone home, was quickly summoned to return to her sister, to which
her parents rather unwillingly gave their consent. Mr. Montagu writes
each post, as often as he could, most affectionate letters to his wife;
as he rode all the way, disliking a carriage, we see by his letters
the time the journey took. March 19, he writes from Nottingham, having
been four days reaching there. He says, “If j was mounted as j ought to
be j could without much difficulty reach Allerthorpe on Monday night,
whereas j must now be content if j get there some time on Tuesday.” He
bids her divert herself with her friends and acquaintances, and to send
him good accounts of her health, “as there is nothing under Heaven that
is so dear to me.”

But no sooner had Mr. Montagu set out than the Duchess of Portland lost
her youngest daughter Frances, just two years old, from convulsions
after whooping cough. She forbade Mrs. Montagu coming to see her at
first, for fear of her grief affecting her in her present condition.
Mrs. Donnellan and Mrs. Pendarves were with the duchess, and did all
they could to solace her grief, which was intense. After a few days,
however, the two friends met, and had a sad meeting.

To return to Mr. Montagu’s travels, he got to Allerthorpe, where Mr.
Carter joined him, and they proceeded to Newcastle, to Mr. Rogers’
house, where

 “three attorneys attended to take inventorys of the goods,
 schedules of the writings and bonds, and whatsoever we found in
 the Secretoires etc. of the unhappy gentleman, but more is owing
 to the dexterity and unintermitting diligence of Mr. Carter in the
 despatch we have made than to everything else put together. We have
 found Bonds amounting to near £10,000 value.”

A general oversight was arranged to be taken by Mr. Carter of the
estates and tenants, many of the latter being heavily in arrears in
rents. It is characteristic of Mr. Montagu’s uprightness in business
that, though not obliged to do so, he rendered to Sir James Clavering,
Mr. Rogers’ uncle, a complete account of his estate, of which Sir James
greatly approved, and regretted these steps were not taken ten years
before. A Mr. Grey was put in charge of Mr. Rogers.

[Page heading: DARNTON FAIR]

Mr. Montagu and Mr. Carter commenced their journey home, the latter
going to Darnton Fair _en route_. People rose early for business then.
Mr. Montagu states Mr. Carter “sat up late last night and rose this
morning at 3, and set out at 6 for Bedale, where he will be occupied
all day.” He adds, “He is unwearied, j never knew his fellow. He has
lived three times as much as any other man no older than he, and has
done three times as much business and benefited many and hurt none. I
wish j could say as much of those who are in a rank of life infinitely
superior to him.” Truly this is a fine picture of a righteous steward.

[Page heading: THE BIRTH OF A SON]

By May 1, when Elizabeth writes to her mother, Mr. Montagu had returned
to her, she and her sister meeting him at Highgate. Mention is made in
this letter of Miss Brockman having become temporarily speechless from
inoculation. Sarah returns to Mount Morris, and the last letter before
Mrs. Montagu’s confinement tells of the purchase of a “magnifique
Berceau” just in time, as on May 11 Mrs. Montagu gave birth, at their
house in Dover Street, to a fine boy, to the infinite joy of Mr.
Montagu and his sister, Mrs. Medows. A young farmer’s wife, a Mrs.
Kennet, living near Mount Morris, had been engaged as a wet-nurse to
the child.

On May 30 the Rev. William Freind, to whom Mr. Montagu had written to
announce the birth of his child, writes to congratulate him, and to say
Mrs. Freind had presented him with a daughter that morning. Mr. Montagu
had promised to stand godfather if it was a boy,[272] but if a daughter
Mrs. Montagu was to be godmother. To this letter, on June 4, Mr.
Montagu replied that his wife and child are doing well, and he says--

 “The latter end of next week we intend for the baptism of our
 infant, and if you were here should be prouder to have the ceremony
 performed by you than anybody else, for if j may judge from what
 has happened to the Father, j imagine it would be auspicious to the
 Son. I am sure j ought never to forget the share you had in putting
 me in the possession of the Mother,[273] in whom j find my every
 wish more than compleated. In less than a fortnight we intend going
 to Sandleford,[274] and after that to go on the inoculation, which
 j hope will have an happy event, which, if so, j cannot be too
 thankful to Providence.”

    [272] This child was christened Elizabeth. She died young.

    [273] Mr. Freind had married them.

    [274] Mr. Montagu’s seat near Newbury.

He adds his desire for Mr. Freind and his family to visit them at
Sandleford _en route_ home from Bath.

[Page heading: INOCULATION]

The reader will remember that Mrs. Montagu was peculiarly afraid
of smallpox, but she had determined, if once a mother, she would be
inoculated, so that she should be able to attend to her child if it
ever had the disease, and to prevent separation from or infection to it
if she herself took the disease in the natural manner. When her dread
of it is recollected, it will appear a heroic deed on her part. Her
mother, Mrs. Robinson, was far from easy at the idea of the inoculation
taking place in the summer heat.

Meanwhile the little boy was christened John, though he soon acquired
the nickname of “Punch,” their own familiar peep-show, as the fond
parents deemed him, and is only twice mentioned in the letters I have
as my little “Jack.”

In a letter of June 21, from the Duchess of Portland, who was at
Welbeck with Lady Oxford, she mentions--

 “The Duke of Kingston[275] has been in the utmost danger, so great
 Doctor Hickman has refrained sleeping part of a night, not without
 the assistance of Barbecued Hog, Tokay, etc., etc., etc. to keep
 up his spirits, to enable him to go through the immense fatigue
 of waking a few hours with his patron.” She adds, “Thank God the
 children are all well. I hope your little man is so, my best wishes
 must ever attend the dear boy.”

    [275] He died in 1773, when the title became extinct.

Mrs. Montagu went to recruit at Sandleford with Mr. Montagu,
preparatory to removing the child and establishment there, as she
writes to her sister Sarah, who, with Mrs. Medows, is left in Dover
Street in charge of the son and heir--

[Page heading: BABY CLOTHES]

 “I really long to have you here. I think I may say you never saw
 anything so pretty as the view these gardens command, for my part I
 would not change the situation for any I ever saw; there is nothing
 in Nature pretty that they have not. The prospect is allegro, and
 as ‘Mirth with thee I chose to live,’ I am glad it is of that kind,
 ‘the loathed melancholy of Cerberus and blackest midnight, born in
 Stygeian cave forlorn,’ dare not appear in this little paradise.
 There is a charming grove where your reveries may wander at
 pleasure, you may allegorize like Spenser, or pastoralize like the
 lesser poets, there are roses and honeysuckles hourly dropping to
 put you in mind ‘how small a part of time they share, that are so
 wondrous sweet and fair,’ and this will whisper to you ‘de coglier
 d’amor la rosa,’ indeed, my dear Sall, these pretty things are mere
 toys, as are all things in this world, but a true friend. I am
 thankful for the benefits of fortune, and pleased with them, but
 really attached only to the person who bestows them. My benefactor
 bestows favours with more pleasure and more complaisance too, than
 most people receive them with, and this gives the relish to favour,
 for as Ophelia says, ‘Gifts grow cheap when givers are unkind.’

 “I hope the young plant thrives under your care. Pray write every
 post, and say all you can about the boy, for as insignificant as
 he seems in his swaddling cloaths, it is more interesting to his
 parents to hear of where he went, than to hear of all the feats of
 Hercules girded in his Lion’s skin.”

 Then she orders a dozen bibs to be made for the babe, of “fine
 damask, the pattern of Lady Betty Bentinck’s pinned to my
 embroidered quilted petticoat.”

[Page heading: SANDLEFORD PRIORY]

Sandleford Priory is two miles south of Newbury, Berks. It was
originally founded by Geoffry, 4th Earl of La Perche, and his wife
Matilda of Saxony, between the years 1193 and 1202, dedicated to St.
Mary and St. John the Baptist, and placed under the Austin Canons;
but Mr. Money, in his “History of Newbury,” states “the recluses of
Sandleford” are mentioned in the Pipe Roll of the 26th of Henry II.,
1180, so that a body of religious had existed there or near before the
date of the building by the Earl de la Perche.[276] In the reign of
Edward IV., _circ._ 1480, a dispute arose between the Prior and the
Bishop of Salisbury, in whose diocese Sandleford lay; in consequence of
this dispute the monastery was forsaken, and the King, at the instance
of the Bishop (Richard Beauchamp), gave it to the Dean and Chapter
of Windsor. In the 26th of Henry VIII. it was stated to be in their
possession, valued at £10.

    [276] His ancestor accompanied the Conqueror to England.

In the time of James I., 1615, Sandleford was declared to be a separate
parish, and unratable from Newbury, but the chapel being dismantled
and unfit for use, £8 a year was ordered to be paid to the Rector of
Newbury, which entitled the occupants of the Priory to a seat in the
Newbury parish church, which has been continued ever since.

The lessees from the Dean and Canons of Windsor appear, from a paper of
my uncle, Lord Rokeby’s, to have been, early in the eighteenth century,
the Pitt Rivers of Stratfieldsaye, by whom the lease was sold in 1717
to William Cradock, Esq., after an intermediate alienation. The lease
was purchased in 1730 by Mr. Edward Montagu, grandson of the 1st Earl
of Sandwich. A letter of April, 1733, of Mr. John Rogers to his aunt,
the Hon. Mrs. Sarah Montagu, at Sandleford, about the death of his
mother, Mrs. Rogers, and her leaving her sister £10, and each of her
three children a ring, is in my possession, and shows she was then
living or staying with her son Edward.

The chapel is erroneously stated in several works (_vide_ Tanner, etc.,
etc.) to be destroyed. It was disused, not destroyed, though the bells,
seats, and the tomb of the crusading knight[277] had disappeared. As
we proceed further into the manuscripts we shall see it was used as a
bedroom or rooms!

    [277] Probably Count Thomas de la Perche, son of the founder, as
 his father was buried at St. Denis Nogent. Thomas died in 1217. For
 a description of the tomb, etc., see note at the end of this book.

The situation of the Priory is charming, the principal rooms fronting
south on a slight eminence, sloping to the river Alebourne, now called
Enborne, which crosses the high-road just below the lower lodge, and
skirts the south side of the park. On the east the ground slopes to a
wooded valley, down which are many ponds, dating from the monks’ time,
some of which were joined together by Mr. Montagu, afterwards more by
his widow, to form lakes. Many fine trees surround it in these days,
and at the time of Mr. Montagu’s first living there, seem to have been
exceedingly numerous; also walled gardens, which are now removed.
Beyond the valley to the east the ground rises in a wooded ridge. The
village here mentioned must have been a few cottages near the mill on
the west, which existed where Sandleford Lodge is now built: these have
all long ago disappeared.

[Illustration: SANDLEFORD PRIORY.]

[Page heading: A PARSON AND HIS WIFE]

To the duchess Mrs. Montagu wrote in raptures of the beauties of
Sandleford, but in the middle of her description states, “Here was I
interrupted by a Parson, his wife and daughter, and I shall not be
reconciled to ‘Prunello and grogram’ again a great while, they robbed
me of those hours I could have dedicated to your grace.” Prunello was
the woollen stuff then used for clerical gowns, grogram a coarse kind
of taffety, a mixture of silk and mohair, applicable to feminine attire.

Mrs. Botham writes on July 8, that as Mrs. Montagu was unable, when her
baby was born, to be applied to, she had given him his father’s name,
John. Lydia Botham had two, if not three, daughters, but this was her
first son.

[Page heading: THE COUNTESS OF GRANVILLE]

From Sandleford Mrs. Montagu returned to London, intending to be
inoculated, but in a letter of July 12 she informs the duchess that Dr.
Mead considered she had better defer the operation till the heat of the
summer was over--in September. In the same letter she states that Mrs.
Medows and herself had called on the old Countess of Granville,[278]
who appears to have been a most garrulous old lady, and Mrs. Montagu
says--

 “She fell with all her violence on my complexion, and behold, she
 certainly by her description takes my forehead to be tortoishell,
 my cheeks to be gold, my eyes to be onyx, and my teeth amber: all
 these are precious things, but Mr. Montagu not having so rich
 a fancy as King Midas, I know not whether he would like such a
 wife. Your Grace may believe I was extremely mortified. The good
 woman says Mrs. Medows looks better and younger for being married;
 but for me I am pale and green, and describes me as worse than
 the apothecary that lives about the rendezvous of death in Caius
 Marius. She is of opinion that lying in has spoiled my face; true
 it is I have furnished a noble pair of chops to the little boy, and
 if mine are a little the lanker for it, I scarce grudge it....”

    [278] Grace, Viscountess Carteret, and Countess Granville in her
 own right.

Further on she says, “Thank you for your kind inquiry after the young
‘Fidget,’ who loves laughing and dancing, and is worthy of the Mother
he sprang from. As for Mrs. Donnellan, she is well. Mrs. Delany is
better than well.”

Mrs. Pendarves had been married on June 9 this same year to the Rev.
Dr. Patrick Delany,[279] afterwards Dean of Down, and an intimate
friend of Swift’s.

    [279] Dr. Delany, born 1686, died 1768; made Dean 1744.

[Page heading: MONKEY ISLAND]

The Montagus, accompanied by Sarah Robinson, now moved with the child
to Sandleford. A letter to the Duchess of Portland of July 26 says--

  “Sandleford, near Newbury.

  “MADAM,

 “If I was as good a poet as Boileau[280] I would complain of
 l’Embarras de Londres, and also of l’Embarras de la Campagne,
 and of the still greater embarras of travelling from one place
 to another. When I had the happiness of your letter, I was so
 encompassed with boxes, trunks and portmanteaus, and even that
 lesser plague of band-boxes, that I could not give myself the
 pleasure of writing to your Grace. Bag and baggage we arrived here
 on Thursday night: first marched the child crying, nurse singing,
 and the Abigails talking; Mr. Montagu, my sister and myself brought
 up the rear. We had fine weather and a pleasant journey. We took a
 boat from the Inn of Maidenhead Bridge, and rowed round his Grace
 of Marlborough’s Island.[281] I had the pleasure of reflecting on
 the agreeable morning I had spent there with you.”

    [280] Nicholas Despreaux Boileau, born 1636, died 1711. French poet
    of note.

    [281] Monkey Island. See _ante_.

Further in the letter she states the duke[282] had planted some cannon
on the borders.

 “Mrs. Medows has promised to take the child while I am sick,[283]
 and I am best satisfied that it will be with her, for I am sure she
 will take care of it, and thank God! it is a very strong healthy
 child; indeed were he otherwise I should not leave him, for I think
 when they are sickly, no one can be tender enough for them but a
 parent.”

    [282] Then the 3rd Duke of Marlborough.

    [283] Meaning when she was to be inoculated.

She says--

 “Dr. Courayer dined with us the day before we left town: he was
 more elated with having a letter from you, than he had been
 dejected with the overthrow of the French;[284] he looks well, and
 his mind is the seat of tranquillity. Donnellan promises to come
 down here soon. I hope she will stay till I go to London to be
 inoculated.”

    [284] Alluding to the battle of Dettingen, fought in June, 1743.

[Page heading: WOMAN’S EDUCATION]

In alluding to a lady who had “excellent sense and wit, but a want of
softness in her manners,” she adds--

 “This is of great consequence to a woman to keep off disagreeable
 manners, for the world does not mind our intrinsic worth so much as
 the fashion of us, and will not easily forgive our not pleasing.
 The men suffer for their levity in this case, for in a woman’s
 education little but outward accomplishment is regarded. Some of
 our sex have an affectation of goodness, others a contempt of
 it from their education; but the many good women there are in
 the world are merely so from nature, and I think it is much to
 the credit and honour of untaught human nature that women are so
 valuable for their merit and sense. Sure the men are very imprudent
 to endeavour to make fools of those to whom they so much trust
 their honour and happiness and fortune, but it is in the nature of
 mankind to hazard their peace to secure power, and they know fools
 make the best slaves.”

A letter early in August to the duchess, who had now returned to
Bullstrode from Welbeck after visiting Matlock, says--

 “I was in hopes to have heard when you would come to town. I wish
 you may come up to us soon after the 24th (August) of this month,
 which is the time I propose for going to London for inoculation.
 I think there is no danger of hot weather after the middle of
 September. Dr. Mead says it is the best time for me....

 “Matlock must be well worth seeing, we have nothing here of the
 wild and uncultivated sort. I intend to go and indulge Reveries
 at an old Castle[285] where Chaucer made his fairies gambol,
 with as much grace and prettiness as the Muses of old on the
 hill of Parnassus. The Castle is on a rising just above Newbury,
 and commands a pretty view of the country. The prospect is of
 sufficient extent to let the poetick fancy soar at pleasure
 among the beauties of Nature. Pray where is ‘Pen,’[286] will she
 produce a sprig of bays? it must be a little Master Apollo or a
 Miss Minerva from parents of such art and science. I have sent
 your Grace a copy of a letter Lord Orford[287] sent to General
 Churchill,[288] if ever he was to be envy’d it was when he wrote
 that letter: it seems to come from a mind pleased with everything
 about it, and easy in itself, amidst the refinement of luxury and
 expense, without the madness of intemperance, or inconveniences of
 prodigality.”

    [285] Donnington Castle.

    [286] Mrs. Delany’s old pet-name.

    [287] _Alias_ the great Sir Robert Walpole.

    [288] General Charles Churchill, commonly called “old Charles
    Churchill,” to distinguish him from his son, who afterwards married
    Mr. Edward Walpole’s daughter; he was the illegitimate son of James
    II. and Arabella Churchill.

[Page heading: LORD ORFORD’S LETTER]

The end of this letter is missing. Lord Orford’s letter, written in an
unknown hand, is thus:--

  “Houghton, June 24, 1743.

  “DEAR CHARLES,

 “(_Lord Orford’s letter to General Churchill._)

 “This place affords no news, no subject of entertainment for fine
 men. Men of Wit and Pleasure about Town understand not the charms
 of the inanimate world: my Flatterers here are Mutes: the Oaks,
 the Brookes, the Chestnuts seem to contend which shall best please
 the Lord of the Mannour; they cannot deceive, they will not Lye.
 I in sincerity admire them and have as many Beauties about me as
 fill up all my hours of dangling, and no disgrace attends me from
 67 years of age. Within doors we come a little nearer to real
 Life, and admire upon the almost speaking canvass all the airs and
 graces which the proudest of Town ladies can boast, with these I
 am satisfied, because they gratifie me with all I wish, and all
 I want, and expect nothing in return, which I cannot give. If
 these, Dear Charles, are any Temptation, I heartily invite you to
 come and partake of them. Shifting the scene sometimes has its
 recommendation, and from Country Fare you may possibly return with
 a keener appetite to the more delicate Entertainments of a refined
 life.

  “I am, dear Charles, etc.,
  “ORFORD.

 “P.S.--Since I wrote the above we have been surprised with good
 news from abroad. Too much cannot be said about it, for it is truly
 matter of infinite Joy, as it is of Infinite Consequence.”

Lord Orford is here alluding to the battle of Dettingen.

[Page heading: THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH]

The duchess, in a letter of August 26 from Bullstrode, says, “Thanks
for Sir Robert’s letter, I had never seen it.” In alluding to the
tiresome etiquette and interference she suffered from at Welbeck under
Lady Oxford’s despotic rule, she says--

 “I please myself that my children will love me better, as my
 covetousness will not be obliged ’em to pay me court, and as I
 shall have no suspicion of their duty, but be convinced that their
 motives proceed from disinterested love, and by that means we shall
 each of us be happy. Was the Duchess of Marlborough[289] possessed
 by one good quality? I should think she deserved pity more than
 the poorest creature in the street, not to have one child, but
 what wishes her dead, nor capable of knowing the enjoyments of
 friendship.... We propose being in London Monday sennight.”

    [289] Sarah, the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough.

On Thursday, August 25, Mrs. Montagu took a sad leave of her little
boy, and started on her journey to London, sleeping at Windsor, at the
house of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows. Mr. Montagu remained with the
child till the time his wife should be inoculated, when he was to join
her in London, and Mrs. Medows was to take charge of him. Sarah joined
her sister in London; it will be remembered she had had the disorder.

[Page heading: PREPARATION FOR INOCULATION]

As inoculation is now out of date, I shall extract from the various
letters the mode of procedure. Arrived in Dover Street, Mrs. Montagu
is told by Elias, the duchess’s porter (then a most important domestic
magnate), his mistress was coming to London on Monday. She therefore
writes to beg the duchess, the duke, and Mr. Achard to dine with
her that day “at 4 or 5 according to their convenience.” Business,
however, prevented the duchess leaving Bullstrode for a week, but she
is reinvited, as Dr. Mead says Mrs. Montagu will not be infectious
till the disease appears. Meanwhile, in preparation for the dreaded
operation, she was “dosed, then blooded, another dose or two of physick
is all I shall want, and then proceed to meet that distemper I have
been running from these four and twenty years: it is at present my
misfortune the smallpox is so little stirring they cannot find a
subject.” She writes to the duchess also in another letter, “Though
Dr. Mead, Dr. Cotes, Mr. Hawkins, and the subaltern of the Physical
faculty, the Apothecary, have been smallpox-hunting this week, they
have not procured a subject for me.” She urges the duchess to dine, “as
I shall be as well till 7 or 9 days after the operation as ever I was
in my life.”

The duchess had been out of order with hysterical fits, and states she
was ordered to drive in a chaise. Of this vehicle we gain a glimpse
from this allusion of Mrs. Montagu’s in answer to the duchess, “A
chaise is health, spirits and speed, a lady must lay aside her hoop,
her laziness and pride, before she is diminutive enough for a chaise.”
A portion of a very beautiful letter, written by Mrs. Montagu to her
husband before he joins her, I copy--

  “Dover Street, Tuesday, August 30.

  “MY DEAREST,

 “The happiest moments I have spent since I parted from you, were
 those I employed in reading your letter: accept the sincerest
 thanks a grateful and tender heart can make to the most kind and
 generous love. While Heaven shall lend me life, I will dedicate
 it to your service, and I hope our tender engagements shall not
 be broke by the cruel hand of fate. Notwithstanding the distemper
 I am going into, I have great hopes of my life, and a certainty
 of my love to you as long as that life shall last. Your kind
 behaviour and conversation has made my Being of such value to me
 that I am taking the best means to preserve and secure it from
 hazards, but let not the experiment cost you an anxious thought.
 It would be a reproach to the laws of Nature, if one as virtuous
 as you are, should not be sure to be happy. I trust you shall ever
 be so independent of a weak woman, who can serve you in nothing
 but wishes: could I reflect back the happiness I receive from you,
 I should tremble at my own importance to think of sinking from
 happiness to insensibility, and nothing might overcome my little
 courage, but to imagine I left you a portion of sorrow and regret
 as a burthen on all your years to come, would not only afflict but
 even distract me.”

[Page heading: THE REV. CHRISTOPHER DONNELLAN]

The same day that she wrote this letter to her husband, she writes
a note to Mrs. Donnellan, who had joined her brother, the Rev.
Christopher Donnellan, at Tunbridge Wells. He, having been ordered to
drink the waters, and having crossed from Ireland for that purpose,
Mrs. Montagu says, “Does not your brother think he is in Babel? How
does he like English women with French dresses and French manners? In
short, what does grave good sense think of Tunbridge?”

By Mr. Montagu’s desire, Dr. Sandys was added to the previous M.D.’s. A
day or two after this Mr. Montagu joined her, and she was inoculated on
September 3.

[Page heading: WHEATEARS]

[Page heading: ARMY DISCIPLINE]

On September 7 Mrs. Montagu writes to Mrs. Donnellan--

  “MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,

 “As the time that passes between the expectation of a matter of
 importance and its happening is not a time of the greatest pleasure
 and tranquillity, you will be glad to hear it is four days since
 I was inoculated. I am still well and in perfect good spirits:
 it would be a sign of levity as I should be sorry and ashamed to
 find in myself to be disturbed at the approach of a distemper I
 have been seeking. The Duchess of Portland spent the day with me
 on Monday, and was here again with Lady Wallingford yesterday, and
 I expect her Grace this afternoon. In the meantime I hope to hear
 from you, and my sister will give you intelligence of me. Dr. Mead
 and Dr. Cotes attend me; I have given them on their prescribing two
 guineas apiece, but I am told when Dr. Mead attends constantly,
 one guinea a day will be enough, if he comes only once a day, but
 I wish you would be so kind as to enquire and let me know when you
 write to me; and I will beg you to order your maid to buy 2 Dozen
 Wheatears[290] and send them by the Haye Coach. Mr. Montagu never
 saw any, so if you please to tell your servant to send them with
 the feathers on.

 “I am extremely glad to hear Mr. Donnellan finds benefit by the
 waters. Your family in Town flourishes much,[291] Mr. Percival is
 a young beau, Mrs. Percival has grown almost a toast, and for Mrs.
 Shuttleworth,[292] she is a perfect beauty, she has a bloom like
 fifteen; I never saw anyone look so fresh and jolly.

 “The town is full of reports of the discontent of the Army, it
 is almost feared the English and H(anoverian)s should fall upon
 each other. A gun going off while the Captain was at dinner, he
 bade General Honeywood go and see what was the matter; the General
 brought word it was nothing, upon which the great Captain sent
 a H(anoveria)n officer, who brought word it was the musket of a
 soldier upon guard; the Captain then cry’d he could have no truth
 from the E(nglis)h and that the E(nglis)h had no discipline: the
 D(uk)e of M(arlboroug)h said they had as much discipline as the
 H(anoverian)s, for that coming by their quarters, a ball went under
 his horse’s legs.

 “Mr. Hawkins[293] comes every day to dress my arms, though the
 wounds given for the inoculation are very trifling, he does not
 think from the appearance of them I shall be ill yet. I shall be
 glad when the proper period for it arrives, but must wait with
 patience; it is said people do not know themselves, but by the
 little anxiety I have about myself, one would imagine I knew myself
 to be of as small consequence as I really am.... My dear little
 Babe is perfectly well....”

    [290] Wheatears are delicious eating. They are migratory, and only
    frequent certain counties. They appear to have been more plentiful
    formerly. Sussex and Surrey are favourite localities.

    [291] These are Mrs. Donnellan’s stepfather and her mother.

    [292] Mrs. Shuttleworth was evidently a relation.

    [293] The surgeon.

[Illustration DENTON HALL.]

[Page heading: PHYSICIANS’ FEES]

To this I subjoin a portion of Mrs. Donnellan’s answer from Tunbridge
Wells--

 “I received your comfortable letter, writ with the spirit of a
 Christian, a Philosopher and a woman of true fortitude. Since you
 don’t expect any appearance yet, I may venture to write, or if
 you should not be quite well, my letter is of no consequence, and
 may be thrown by. I will allow all your reasoning for yourself to
 be very good, and will not dispute with you now, whether you are
 of consequence to the world or not, I will only beg you to act as
 if you were, and take care of yourself for the sake of the few,
 and let the world come in for its share of you by an by. I am of
 opinion one guinea a day is sufficient from a private gentle woman
 to any Physician in England, if he makes but one visit. I know all
 our family, and greater than us never gave more either to Hollins
 or Willmot; indeed if they prescribe twice they must be paid
 twice, but that I hope and believe will not be your case. I am not
 acquainted with anyone who makes use of Dr. Mead, but I suppose he
 is fee’d like other Physicians of note, and I think raising these
 sort of things on one another when they are already high enough by
 conscience is wrong....

 “Our company quits us apace, but as there is not one body but Lady
 Sunderland[294] and Miss Sutton and Lady Catherine Hanmer that I
 care particularly for, and they stay, I am quite easy about the
 matter. I generally take a rural walk with my maid and man, and
 I am just returned from the Rocks, whose natural beauties strike
 me more agreeably than the laboured work of a palace. My brother
 rides every day, but walking does not agree with him.... No one
 here cares for a walk that carries them further than Tod’s Room or
 Chenevix’s Shop.[295] In the evening I conform with the world, and
 play at Whisk, Roli Poli, or what they will, and make them wonder
 that a person who has a guinea in their pockets and can perform at
 such entertainments, should prefer wandering in fields and woods
 with company little better than the creatures that inhabit them.”

    Sunderland; remarried Right Hon. Sir Robert Sutton.

On September 12 Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess, who had returned
to Bullstrode, to say Mr. Hawkins did not believe, from the appearance
of her arms, she would have the smallpox. Dr. Mead and Dr. Cotes had
attended the day before, expecting to find inflammation, but the wounds
appeared healed. From this it appears the surgeon attended the wounds
daily, and doctors occasionally. The very next day (September 13) Mr.
Hawkins pronounced there was no longer a chance of the smallpox.

Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess, “As Anacreon who swallowed many a
hogshead of the juice of the grape was at last killed with a little
grape stone, I who have missed the dire disease, am grumbling with the
toothache.”

[Page heading: POPE’S GROTTO]

The duchess writes to Mrs. Montagu to beg her to think that though
the smallpox has _not_ appeared, she is as much secured as if it had.
On September 15, as a wind-up to the inoculation, Mrs. Montagu “was
blooded.”

“On Saturday we went to see Mr. Pope’s[296] garden and grotto, to
Hampton Court and Bushey Park,” she writes to the duchess; and on
Wednesday she was intending to pay a visit to her parents at Mount
Morris, Kent, before returning to her child, for whom, she says, “her
heart sickens.” On October 8 she proceeded to Sandleford, leaving Mr.
Montagu, who had business, to follow in a few days; and she writes
to the duchess from the inn at Maidenhead Bridge. In this letter she
says she has great difficulty in “squeezing the cotton in the ink
bottle which I am forced to do before each word, and as my pen is as
prodigal of ink, as the bottle is sparing of it, after I have been
half an hour replenishing my pen, one inconsiderate blot squanders it
away.” This alludes to the strange habit of having cotton placed in
the inn inkstand, under the delusion that it made it last longer. The
whole writing of the letter is thick and blotted. She also mentions,
“My sister set out for Bath this morning, with Mrs. Cotes. Poor madam
Sally’s stomach is greatly out of order, and her nerves are often
affected, but I hope the waters will do her good.”

    [296] Pope’s villa and grotto at Twickenham.

[Page heading: A HIGHWAYMAN]

Mrs. Cotes was the doctor’s wife, and a sister of Lord Irwin, a great
friend of Sally’s, very small in stature and pretty, familiarly called
“the _little_ Madam.” The two ladies, accompanied by Mrs. Cotes’
footman, set out for Bath, diverging from Newbury for a night at
Sandleford to see “Punch.” A passage from a letter of Sarah’s will show
the perils of the road. They travelled in a post-chaise--

 “A man set out with us from London, and kept us company about seven
 miles. He often asked the footman who we were, and whether we were
 going over Hounslow Heath; to the last he made no answer, but after
 being tired with his curiosity told him we were only ladies’ maids,
 upon which he forsook us, either being too proud to accompany
 abigails, or supposing we had not money enough to make it worth his
 while to go on to Hounslow Heath with us. We had one post-boy that
 pleased us extremely, he sung all the way, our pleasure did not
 arise from any music in his voice, but from seeing him so happy,
 and admiring the power of a contented spirit, that could make a
 person so joyful, that was at the caprice of any one, without any
 greater advantage than a shilling’s reward, and who is always to be
 jolted almost to death, by the only creatures that are beneath him.”

Almost shaken to pieces, they arrived at their lodgings at Mrs.
Elliot’s, in the Orange Grove, Bath. Sarah describes the rooms as
small, but comfortable, “looking down Wade’s Passage and into the
coffee-house, which is a guard to the windows, and very often prevents
their approach.” She grumbles at the expense of their journey, but says
provisions are cheap, fowls one shilling each.

Jenny, her maid, had travelled by coach, a post-chaise of that time
only holding two people. Here is a passage worthy of Fielding, “Jenny
travelled down unspotted and pure with the old parson, who gave her
no comfort, but one spiritual kiss upon getting to the end of their
journey.”

[Page heading: DANGERS OF A POST-CHAISE]

Both Mrs. Cotes and Sarah suffered from the hardness of the
post-chaise, and Sarah also hints that other _visible_ effects had been
incurred which would last for days; hence fleas, if not worse, must
have existed in it! Mrs. Montagu, in writing to condole with them,
says, “It is a daring mind that ventures in a post-chaise. I wonder
the partizans of these vehicles do not establish a broad bottom, and
a competent share of cushion.” The vehicle was, from what I make out,
a two-wheeled chaise. Mrs. Cotes’ footman had been directed to call,
on his way back to London, on Mrs. Montagu. The style of speech of a
servant of this period is shown in this passage--

 “Mrs. Cotes’ man called very civilly, and brought me your last
 letter. ‘Pray, Mr. Thomas,’ says I, ‘did you leave the ladies
 well?’ ‘Yes, and very merry, Madam.’ ‘They had a good journey, I
 hope?’ ‘Yes, a very merry, Madam.’ ‘They were not at all afraid?’
 ‘No, nothing but very merry, Madam.’ ‘Were they not tired when
 they came to their inns?’ ‘No, always very merry, Madam!’ At last
 Thomas’s account made me ‘so merry, Madam,’ I was forced to retire
 to laugh.

 “Your nephew gets his share of sunshine every day, his teeth tease
 him and produce the dew of sorrow on his little cheeks sometimes,
 but in a moment it is forgotten, and he is always lively, and in
 continual health: he is thought to grow like his mother, so I think
 I may cease to be handsome with a good grace, as I have transferred
 it to my offspring.... Your nephew is in his birthday suit,
 laughing so I can hear him through the doors; the usurpation and
 authority of those bandages called garments he is too full of Whig
 principles to approve of!”

[Page heading: “PUNCH’S” CHARIOT]

There were no babies’ carriages in those days, so little Punch drove
out daily in the _chariot_, not to be confounded with the _coach_, a
much larger vehicle.

In the same letter it appears that the good old Yorkshire steward, Mr.
Carter, had had a bad fall, and the house in Dover Street not being
large enough, Morris Robinson was trying to secure them one in Bruton
Street. Mrs. Montagu, having suffered from weakness and hysterical
fits, was recommended to ride daily--a pastime which was agreeably
varied by the cutting of new walks through the Sandleford woods,
and the continual amusement afforded to her and Mr. Montagu by the
contemplation of their child’s too precocious ways.

A few details of life at Bath may prove amusing. Sarah writes to her
sister that the waters agree very well with her, but that people are
amazed at her walking between each glass. She had found a companion in
Mrs. Wadman, Lord Windsor’s sister, whom she had met at the pump-room,
as they drank the waters about the same time, and both were fond of
walking.

The Rev. W. Freind and his wife were at Bath, and Sarah goes to hear
him preach a charity sermon,

 “the best I ever heard. I am going to dress to the best of my
 skill and power for the sake of his Majesty, this is kept as his
 birthday, and there is to be a ball and supper to-night, the men
 have subscribed on purpose. Mr. Simon Adolphus Sloper[297] is
 to be my partner, and has sent me his tickets, which will carry
 in Mrs. Freind also. Mrs. Cotes’ cold is too bad to go.... The
 Archbishop[298] is much censured for going away so soon, he has not
 tried the waters long enough to know whether they would be of any
 use to such an extream case as his.... Mrs. Potter would let her
 husband see nobody but herself, and took his duty of preaching upon
 herself; she tempered it with a comfortable compliance, and when he
 used to say ‘I am sure I shall dye, I wish it might be at home,’
 ‘To be sure, my dear,’ answers the good wife, ‘it is proper you
 should dye where you like, if you chuse it you shall go and dye at
 Lambeth.’ ...”

    [297] Mr. Sloper lived at West Woodhay, near Newbury.

    [298] John Potter, born 1674, died 1747. Archbishop of Canterbury.

[Page heading: A BATH BALL]

At one of the balls Sarah did not dance, but she said she did not
regret it, “having no inclination to dance with any man but Mr.
Pitt,[299] and that I have not acquaintance enough with him to expect,
I can only cherish my hopes of future good fortune.” At another
ball she dances with Mr. Vanburgh, “a very pretty sort of man, but
our affections to him are quite Platonic, as he is in love with the
youngest Miss Nash.” This must have been the sister or daughter of Mr.
Richard Nash[300] (“Beau Nash”), the despotic Master of the Ceremonies
at Bath. He was not well at this time, and Mrs. Montagu sends her kind
regards and condolences on his health. Amongst other people mentioned
at Bath by Sarah were the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Berkeley, Mr. Powlett,
and Mr. Bathurst, son of Lady Selina, the two Offleys, Mr. Greville,
and Lord Robert Carr, said to be very handsome.

 “Last night in the middle of the dancing we drank tea with a
 gentleman who had invited about twenty of us some days before. They
 give tea now almost as much of common days as they used to do on
 Sundays.”

    [299] Afterwards Earl of Chatham.

    [300] Richard Nash, for fifty years Master of the Ceremonies, Bath.

Sarah says she is going to play shuttlecock with a Mr. Amiens,[301] at
the end of this letter; and in the next she states--

 “I played at Shuttlecock about half an hour, there were five couple
 of us: in truth I played so much better than any in the room, I put
 them all in amazement, but it was rather owing to their bad play,
 and to my being matched with the two men that played the best,
 than my superior skill.... In my last I mentioned I was going to
 the ball: there was a table of sweetmeats, jellies, wine, Biskets,
 cold Ham and Turkey set behind two Screens, which at 9 o’clock were
 taken away, and the table discovered.... Above stairs there was a
 hot supper for all that would take the trouble to go up.”

    [301] I think this was Mr. Amyand?

[Page heading: “MATHEMATICAL INSTERATION!”]

The ignorance of some ladies of this period is shown by Sarah in the
following extract:--

 “A lady told us last night that Miss Molyneux is so great a
 _Mathematician_ that she can _inster_ Greek, and that often a dozen
 of the most learned men of the Kingdom had puzzled their wise heads
 about a piece of Greek, and could make nothing of it; they proposed
 to send it to Miss Molyneux, and she _instered_ it (_alias_
 construed it), and returned them her _insteration_!”

Whilst Sarah was at Bath, Mrs. Montagu wrote frequently to her mother
at Mount Morris, much, naturally enough, about her child, about whom
the fond grandmother was never tired of hearing. A little sentence
gives a clue to his looks, “If my Father has drawn a blue-eyed
simpering Cherubim, you may fancy him not unlike your grandchild; the
child’s eyelashes are black and long, and he has a laughing look in his
eyes, blue, like my Father.” He was still toothless, and suffered much
with his gums, which made his mother already uneasy. Mr. Montagu had
just taken some prodigious sized carp from a fish-pond at Sandleford,
and was throwing three of the old monks’ ponds, or fish stews, into one
large one.

Mrs. Donnellan writes from Bullstrode on October 21, and says her
brother is now going to Bath, where he will stay with their relations
the Mountraths,[302] and that Sarah Robinson, “if she meets him she
must make the advances, all the young ladies do, as he is a grave,
stiff Parson.” Dr. Young and Lady Peterborough[303] were at Bullstrode
when she wrote.

    [302] 6th Earl of Mountrath and his wife.

[Page heading: MIDGHAM]

In a letter to the duchess of October 25, Mrs. Montagu describes the
gardens at Midgham, the seat of Mr. Poyntz,[304] near Aldermaston,

 “to which Mr. Montagu carried me last week, I had no small
 expectations of them, both from report and the known sense and
 genius of the owner.... Over the door of a little grotto he
 declares for retirement in open fields, caves and dens, with living
 waters and woods. Statues of the Muses adorn his walls, their
 Arts adorn his mind and inspire him with the elegant ingenious
 gratitude that gives this public demonstration of honour to them.
 Every venerable oak has a seat under it from whence he takes the
 sacred oracles of meditation.... The gardens are of uneven ground,
 prettily diversified with hills and valleys. There is a fine bason
 before the house, that is always well supplied with water, and
 inhabited by fish.... I did not see Mr. Poyntz’s house, as it is
 not anything extraordinary, it would have been an impertinent
 curiosity to desire it, as they visit here when in the country.”

    [304] Right Hon. Stephen Poyntz, Lord Treasurer.

Mrs. Donnellan writes for the duchess as well as herself in reply, Lady
Oxford being there, and all the usual writing-hours given up to playing
Pope Joan with her. In this letter, alluding to “Punch” watching with
pleasure the colour of his bed-curtains, she says, “Master Wesley,[305]
who is the most extraordinary child for sense I ever knew, at three
months old, used to be put in a good humour with a suit of tawdry
Tapestry hangings.”

    [305] This was Garrett Wesley, afterwards Earl of Mornington. He
 was Mrs. Donnellan’s godson, born 1735, died 1781.

The Duke of Portland had the misfortune to break his arm at the end of
November, just as the Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Delany had arrived for their
first visit since their marriage on June 9.

[Page heading: A FOOTPAD]

In writing to condole with the duchess, a typical story of a footpad
is given by Mrs. Montagu. The duchess had just set up keeping bees at
Bullstrode, and Mrs. Montagu intended to do the same, but laments she
cannot

 “have anything of a menagerie[306] here, there is no trusting
 anything out of doors. The town of Newbury is a melancholy example
 of the decay of trade, there is misery and poverty and lawless
 necessity in an unhappy abundance. We have robbing upon the commons
 here very frequently: a poor labourer who has been digging in our
 garden last week was very oddly preserved from a wound by a Buckler
 made of Cheese, like Sardella in ‘The Rehearsal.’ The poor man had
 five shillings in his pocket, when he was stopped by a footpad.
 He did not care to surrender his wealth, and so resisted; another
 robber came to his comrade’s assistance, and stuck a knife several
 inches deep into some cheese and bread he had over his bosom, in a
 wallet betwixt his coat and waistcoat. We had a highwayman taken by
 a French dancing master a little while ago. When the dancing master
 carried him before the Justice of Peace, the Justice asked what day
 of the month he was robbed? ‘Ah,’ says the dancing master, ‘me can
 no tell dat,’ but turns to the highwayman, ‘but you do know, I pray
 tell Monsieur, for you must know what day you did rob, and I pray
 you now be so civil as tell de gentleman,’ which, as the highwayman
 denied the fact of the robbery, was as good a blunder as one could
 desire. The highwayman has since cut his throat, but is likely to
 recover, only to try the hempen collar.”

    [306] Menagerie was the name given to a collection of birds, from
 rare fowl to pheasants, etc.

Mr. Montagu had started that morning (December 1) for the meeting of
Parliament, Mrs. Montagu accompanying him “halfway to Reading.”

[Page heading: THE MINISTRY]

A letter of December 3 of Mr. Montagu’s shows the state of politics in
the House--

 “I have been making what enquiry j could about the state of public
 affairs, and can learn nothing that is agreeable to one who loves
 Great Britain, and is more concerned for his country than the
 fatal E(lecto)r of H(anove)r. For though the ministry have been at
 variance about some of the treaties mentioned in the Speech and in
 the Privy Council, they came to Division, where Lord Carteret and
 his friends were only four, and the opposers, j, amongst whom were
 Mr. Pelham and Lord Chancellor and others, still matters have since
 been so far made up amongst them that it is said they all agreed
 (by the mediation of Lord Orford) in the speech and address, which
 is reckoned to be Lord Carteret’s, and after a division in our
 House, the address was carried by a considerable majority, the yeas
 being 278 against 149 noes. Mr. Pitt exerted himself against the
 address with his usual eloquence and with great acrimony against a
 Minister whom j need not name, after j shall tell you that in his
 invective he said what he meant was not against the Ministry, but
 against one who was a Minister, and had renounced Great Britain,
 who had eat of a certain tree that the Poet tells us makes People
 forget everything, even their country, but he hoped the people
 would never taste of the fruit of the same tree, nor after his
 example forget their country.... Mr. Pelham is to be Chancellor
 of the Exchequer, Sandys Pay Master of the Army. The Duke of
 Marlborough[307] has resigned.”

    [307] He resigned his commission in disgust.

[Page heading: POPE’S “DUNCIAD”]

A letter of December 4 of Mrs. Montagu to the duchess makes the
following comments on the new edition of Pope’s “Dunciad,”[308] to
which he had just added a fourth book:--

 “We got Mr. Pope’s new Dunciad printed, but I think it differs
 little from the old one: the new Hero[309] is certainly worthy to
 have the precedency over all foolish Poets. I like the last Dunciad
 for exposing more sorts of follies than the first did, which was
 merely upon bad poets and bad criticks. I am always glad when I
 see those fops who have translated their manners and language into
 French foppery well ridiculed for the absurd metamorphosis, to
 ridicule wrong placed pride is of great service, for if it was not
 done this land would be over-run with conceit, for here people are
 proud of their vices and follies and iniquity, and as long as Pride
 arises from such Stocks, we shall never want an increase of it.
 Milton says, ‘_Nought profits more than self-esteem right placed_,’
 and surely it is true of that pride that makes us disdain vice, but
 that which makes people glory in it is as pernicious. The British
 vice of gluttony is openly professed so much, one can hardly dine
 at a fashionable table where eating is not the discourse the whole
 time, and treated of as an affair of the utmost consequence.”

    [308] A satire by Alexander Pope.

[Page heading: MRS. POCOCK]

In a letter of December 8, after congratulating the duchess on the
duke’s recovery from his broken arm, Mrs. Montagu adds this description
of the learned Mrs. Pocock;[310] it is interesting, in contrast with
that of the lady who _insters_ Greek!--

 “I have been petrifying my brain over a most solid and ponderous
 performance of a woman in this neighbourhood; having always a
 love to see Phœbus in petticoats, I borrowed a book written by
 an ancient gentlewoman skilled in Latin, dipped in Greek and
 absorbed in Hebrew, besides a modern gift of tongues. By this
 learned person’s instruction was Dr. Pococke[311] (her son)
 skilled in antique lore while other people are learning to spell
 monosyllables, but Hebrew being the mother tongue, you know it
 is no wonder he learnt it. His gingerbread was marked with Greek
 characters, and his bread and butter instead of glass windows
 was printed with Arabick, he had a mummy for his jointed baby,
 and a little pyramid for his playhouse. Mrs. Pocock lives in a
 village[312] very near us, but has not visited here, so I have
 not had an opportunity to observe her conversation, but really I
 believe she is a good woman, though but an indifferent Author. She
 amuses herself in the country so as to be cheerful and sociable at
 three score, is always employed either reading, working or walking,
 and I don’t hear she is pedantic.... She always carries a Greek or
 Hebrew Bible to Church.... I desire your Grace to make ten thousand
 apologies for me to Mrs. Delany if it is true I have robbed her of
 a good name, but I hope you only said this to put me in terrors. I
 desire my best compliments to her, Dr. Delany, to whom I wish very
 well, though I have offered the shadow of a great injury in seeming
 to deprive them of each other.”

    [310] Daughter of the Rev. Isaac Milles, Rector of Highclere, a
    very learned man.

    [311] Rev. Dr. Richard Pococke, eminent Orientalist, Bishop of
    Meath, born 1704, died 1765. Dr. Pococke added the “e” to his name.

    [312] Newtown.

This was caused by Mrs. Montagu, in a fit of absence, having addressed
a congratulatory letter to Mrs. Delany as Mrs. Pendarves, her former
name, which caused much mirth in the Bullstrode circle.

Mr. Montagu writes on December 8--

 “We had yesterday a motion of consequence in the House, which was
 to have an humble address presented to his Majesty to forthwith
 dismiss the Hanoverians in the British pay, which occasioned a
 fine debate, and was carried in the negative by a majority of 50,
 the numbers being 181 against 131. The same is to come on tomorrow
 before the House of Lords, and Lord Sandwich is to begin, which j
 doubt not he will do in the best manner.”

Dr. Freind, who, with his wife, was invited to spend Christmas at
Sandleford, playfully bids Mrs. Montagu to write him a sermon to preach
before the King, as he will have to do in a few weeks.

The year ends with Sarah and Morris Robinson and the Freinds staying at
Sandleford.


[Year: 1744]

The first letter of interest in 1744 is one from Mr. Montagu to his
wife, written February 23, from London, whither he had returned for the
meeting of Parliament.

[Page heading: SUGAR TAX]

After alluding to parliamentary debates and elections, and to the
failure of the new tax proposed upon sugar, “which was carried in the
negative by a majority of 8 only, to the great joy of those concerned
in the Sugar Colonies, and the duty is to be raised on the surplusage
of the tax which was given upon spirituous liquors[313] last year,” he
says--

 “The danger of the Pretender, if we may believe our wise and
 vigilant ministers, is not yet blown over. It is said that a few
 days ago several French men of war were seen off Rye and that
 the Pretender’s Eldest Son has been seen walking about publickly
 at Calais, and is styled Charles the 3rd, his Father having
 relinquished his rights in his favour; but people seem to be little
 affected with any apprehensions of danger, and what the designs of
 the French were, a little time will discover; whatever they shall
 prove to have been j am heartily sorry for the alarm, and whatever
 ground or no ground there has been for the rumour of an invasion,
 j am afraid it will be made use of as a pretence for a further
 plundering of us, and invasion of our pockets, for j cannot forget
 what j have heard before j sat in the House, that a member (I think
 his name was Hungerford) should say the Pretender was the best
 wooden leg a ministry ever had to beg with, and perhaps the present
 may have as much inclination to make use of it as ever any of their
 worthy predecessors had.”

    [313] Tax on spirits, passed 1742–3.

[Page heading: THE PRETENDER]

[Page heading: SIR JOHN NORRIS]

On February 25 Mr. Montagu writes--

 “Since my last the King has sent another message to the House
 with some intelligencies concerning the invasion and the French
 King’s[314] answer to Mr. Thompson,[315] our agent in Paris in
 relation to the removal of the Pretender’s Son out of France,
 in pursuance of treaties which in substance is as follows,
 viz.:--‘That engagements entered into by treaties are not binding
 any further than those treaties are religiously observed by the
 contracting parties on all sides. That when the King of England
 shall have caused satisfaction to be given on the repeated
 complaints that have been made to him of the infractions of these
 very treaties of which he now demands the performance, which
 violations were committed by his orders, his Most Christian
 Majesty will then explain himself upon the demands now made by Mr.
 Thompson in the name of his Majesty.’ Besides this there was a long
 affidavit of a Master of the packet boat read, letting us know that
 he saw a young man who was called the Chevalier, and said to be the
 Pretender’s Eldest Son, with another young man, his brother, that
 there was arrived there Count Saxe,[316] who was to bring over here
 in transports, 1500 men, together with several particulars too long
 to be inserted here.... The House addressed his Majesty to augment
 his forces both by sea and land as much as be necessary, and that
 they would defray the expense.

 “An express arrived yesterday that Sir John Norris[317] with
 his squadron was in sight of the French fleet, that he stood
 off Romney, and they were at Dengeness, that he weighed anchor
 and would endeavour to come up with them, and bring them to an
 engagement if possible. It was this morning reported he had
 demolished them, but this wants confirmation, as well as the news
 of Admiral Matthew’s[318] having beat the Toulon fleet,[319] with
 which there has been an engagement.”

    [314] Louis XV.

    [315] The English Resident.

    [316] Maurice, Comte de Saxe, born 1696, died 1750. Field-Marshal
    of France.

    [317] Admiral Sir John Norris, died 1749.

    [318] Admiral Thomas Matthews, born 1681, died 1751.

    [319] On February 9.

Mrs. Montagu and her sister now joined Mr. Montagu in Dover Street,
leaving little “Punch” at Sandleford with regret. On the way their
coachman, who had met them at Hounslow with their own chaise, ran a
race with a coach and four, and overturned them, but they were none the
worse; in fact, being upset in a carriage in those days seems to have
been little thought of!

A letter of March 4 of Mrs. Robinson from Mount Morris says--

 “Sir John Norris is returned into the Downs, and all our fears are
 over. I heard that the people of Romney and Lydd had their most
 valuable goods packed up and put in carts ready to drive away,
 if they saw any occasion: for my part I was very composed, never
 thinking there would be any occasion to put myself in a stickle....
 I am so good a subject to his Majesty that I can’t conceive any
 people would be so foolish to assist France with setting up a
 Popish Pretender.”

A letter from the duchess states that she has been reading Lord
Bolingbroke’s “Dissertations upon Partys,” and desires Mrs. Montagu’s
opinion on them. She laughs at the idea of the invasion, and says,
“Cecil, the Pretender’s agent, is taken up, and likewise Carle, and
some say Lord Weims,[320] others his second son Charles.”

    [320] James, 5th Earl of Wemyss.

[Page heading: SIR SEPTIMUS ROBINSON]

In a letter to Mr. Freind, Mrs. Montagu mentions meeting at a drum of
Mrs. Mainwaring’s “My cousin Septimus Robinson, dressed as gay as a
lover, but whether that was the footing he was upon, I do not know.”

Septimus Robinson was a brother of Mrs. Freind, and, as his name
denotes, was the seventh child of William Robinson of Rokeby. He was
born in 1710, was educated at Oxford, then entered the army, and served
in the ’45, under General Wade. He left the army in 1754; became
Governor to the Dukes of Gloucester and Cumberland, brothers of George
III., and eventually was made Usher of the Black Rod. He died unmarried
in 1765.

In the same letter she states--

 “Lestock and Matthews are now examined before the Parliament as to
 their conduct in the Mediterranean. It is said by some who have
 read it Thompson’s[321] new play is equal to Otway’s[322] _Orphan_
 and Rowe’s[323] _Fair Penitent_.”

    [321] James Thomson, born 1700, died 1748. Poet; author of “The
    Seasons.”

    [322] Thomas Otway, born 1651, died 1685.

    [323] Nicholas Rowe, born 1673, died 1718. Poet Laureate.

She adds--

 “In the morning all throng to the Senate House, and at night to
 the playhouse;[324] those who bewail the poverty of the nation
 in the morning, part with gold for two hours’ entertainment at
 the Oratorio at night. Those who talk of taxation, did they but
 see how full of powder, and how empty of thought the heads of
 the Hydra appear to be, they would fear nothing from so spruce a
 set of Senators. I think the town was never so gay or so fond of
 amusements.”

    [324] Garrick was acting “King Lear” then.

On March 31, 1744, the Duke of Portland wrote to announce the birth of
his second son, Lord Edward,[325] saying--

    [325] Lord Edward Charles Bentinck, died 1819.

 “I should be wanting in regard to the long friendship which has
 existed between you and my wife, were I not to give you the
 earliest notice of your friend: she was safely brought to bed of a
 boy this morning, at three quarters after 3. She and the child are
 as well as can be expected.”

[Page heading: “HIDE” PARK]

The Montagus now returned to Sandleford to visit their child, leaving
Sarah in Dover Street to await her father’s arrival from Kent to fetch
her. A passage in the following letter throws a light on the vehicles
in use at this period:--

 “Passing through Hide Park,[326] we saw capering horses with
 creatures on their backs more whimsical than themselves.... Between
 London and Kensington were many pert folk in single Horse Chairs,
 who seemed proud of the government of the humblest machine, saving
 a wheelbarrow, that ever the art of man contrived: one of these
 chaises had like to have suffered by contending with his Grace’s
 coach and six. Towards Uxbridge we met a leathern vehicle called a
 flying coach, a most intolerable counterfeit, for in fact it merely
 crawls. We passed two or three travelling waggons laden with many a
 ton of Humanity, the savour of which would have made the delicate
 nostril a misanthrope.... Our dear little fellow is all alive and
 merry, and more grown in length than breadth.”

    [326] _Sic_. Query, was it originally _Hide Park_?

[Page heading: A DOMESTIC COMEDIAN!]

Dr. Freind, now made a Prebendary of Westminster, in addition to his
living at Witney, in this year sent a present of Witney blankets to
Mrs. Montagu and a Witney rug to Sarah Robinson. On April 8 Mrs.
Montagu writes to thank him, and says--

 “Your kind present is significant of the warmth of a friend. I
 think there is great analogy between friendship and a blanket. We
 have been here (Sandleford) almost a fortnight, much diverted with
 the humours of ‘Punch,’ who grows a merry fellow. I like my little
 comedian so well, I shall be sorry to change him for the great
 comedians; my little actor has no artifice but hide and seek, nor
 plays any tricks but innocent Bopeep.

 “I hope now Lord Carteret is going to take a young, handsome
 Lady[327] his politicks will take a milder tone....

 “Have you seen Dr. Gregory and his bride? When I saw the Doctor
 at Mrs. Knight’s, I did not apprehend he designed to be our dear
 cousin.”

    [327] His second wife, Lady Sophie Fermor, daughter of 1st Earl
    Pomfret; married April 14, 1744.

This is the first mention of Dr. John Gregory, afterwards such an
intimate friend of the Montagus. He was the son of Dr. James Gregory,
an eminent physician, by his second marriage with Anne Chalmers, and
grandson of James Gregory, who invented the Gregorian telescope. His
bride, who, judging from the above, must have been a cousin of the
Robinsons, was Elizabeth,[328] daughter of William, 13th Baron Forbes,
by his wife Dorothy Dale. Lady Forbes lost £20,000 in the South Sea
bubble. Dr. John Gregory[329] became a distinguished physician, and an
author of note. Frequent mention of him will be made later on.

    [328] She had beauty, wit, and a large fortune.

    [329] A daughter of his married A. Allison, and was mother of the
    historian.

In the same letter Mrs. Montagu urges Dr. Freind to write and
congratulate the duchess on her second son’s birth. The Freinds had
just commenced a friendship with the Portlands.

[Page heading: GOWNS]

Mrs. Robinson asks her daughter, who had now returned to London, to buy
her a lutestring gown, “but as I have a tabby of a dark brown, I would
have my lutestring pretty light.” This gown, from a further letter,
appears to have cost 6_s._ 9_d._ a yard, and Mrs. Montagu suggests she
should buy a French trimming of Mademoiselle for the same, “a slight
pretty thing for a guinea.” A capucin Mrs. Robinson had ordered; she
says, “I like my capucin much better than that which was shorter, and
it is quite good enough for the use one makes of them.” Probably a hood
with a deep cape, as in a previous letter the garment is described as
“always ugly, but useful.”

Mrs. Robinson says, “I suppose you have had your promised visit from
Mrs. Middleton.[330] I believe the doctor would give something to be in
the state of widowhood once again; she is queer and ill-tempered, and
he heartily tired with it.”

    [330] Mrs. Conyers Middleton No. 2.

Mrs. Botham, Mrs. Laurence Sterne’s sister, had been in London, and
Mrs. Montagu had written to her mother--

 “Mrs. Botham is really quite well behaved, she has not anything of
 the Hoyden now. I believe she is one of the best wives and best
 Mothers, and an admirable housewife. I bought a very handsome
 quarter lace cap for my godson, and presented her with it. Mr.
 Botham wants to be a King’s Chaplain, and I have offered her my
 interest with her Grace of Portland, who by means of Bishop Egerton
 and others could easily get it for him.”

To this her mother[331] replies--

    [331] Mrs. Botham was Mrs. Robinson’s niece.

 “I am much pleased with the character you give of Mrs. Botham, I
 always thought her one of good understanding and good temper, and
 as to her giddiness, I hope it is partly wore off. I should have
 been pleased to have seen her at Horton, if her time had admitted.
 She always had a chearful, agreeable disposition. I much fear his
 being chaplain to his Majesty, if he should succeed, will be no
 advantage to him, for as I take it, must occasion London journeys,
 and without good interest he may be no nearer preferment.... I
 believe his income is but small, and his family increases very
 fast. I wish they have not a spirit of generosity much superior to
 it, they keep a good deal of company, and of the expensive kind.”

At a party at the Duchess of Portland’s the bride, Lady Carteret, is
thus described by Mrs. Montagu--

 “She came in a sack and a night-cap for which she made an apology,
 and said she had a cold. I suppose she designs to carry her dignity
 high enough by this, particularity of dress. She is handsome
 enough, has a good air, a genteel, easy address without any
 _mauvaise honte_.”

[Page heading: FANS]

In a letter of Sarah’s, May 10, thanking her sister for a fan, she
reminds her she was then at “Mrs. May in Tooke’s Court, in Cursitor
Alley, Chancery Lane.” She also mentions buying a tabby gown, 7_s._
3_d._ a yard, at Wells and Hartley, at the “Naked Boy and Woolpack,” in
Ludgate Street. Mrs. Montagu replying, says--

 “I am glad you like the fan; there are some worn at present that
 exceed the flails of a mill. Cotes has one that makes an eclipse of
 her little person whensoever she pleases to flirt it. I have been
 buying finery for your nephew, a famous pink satin coat, and two
 flowered lawn frocks, extremely fine.”

[Page heading: A PINK SATIN COAT]

“Punch,” being now turned a year old, was to be weaned, and many were
the anxieties and qualms of his mother on that occasion. Her mother
wrote wise advice to her on the subject, with her experience of a large
family. After this she adds--

 “He must be most delightful now he runs and prattles, he will look
 a little angel in his finery....

 “I find you are still a house hunting: as to the house you mention
 in Grosvenor Square, I think the fault of it cannot be in the
 goodness of the house or situation, for, as I take it, they are all
 calculated for large fortunes.

 “It gave me great joy to hear my Robert got safe to Bengall. I hope
 by the end of the summer, we shall have him safe here, and poor
 ‘Pigg’ with him.”

“Poor Pigg” was a pet-name for Charles Robinson, who suffered from weak
eyes, and had accompanied his brother on this voyage for health’s sake.

The weaning of “Punch” was successfully carried out, and we learn from
the letters from Mrs. Montagu to her husband, who was still detained in
London, that he was fed on “milk porridge, bread and rusks, and drinks
milk and water all day.”

A letter of Mr. Montagu’s of June 7 mentions meeting the Duke and
Duchess of Portland coming from church at the Banqueting Hall, White
Hall, and accompanying them home. Mr. Carter, the faithful steward, and
his son Willy, who had just returned from the war wounded, were in town.

 “Yesterday I waited on the Duke of Montagu[332] about our young
 Hero (Wm. Carter), who will get made a lieutenant, which does not
 give us the same satisfaction as a Captain’s commission would do,
 but the Duke said they would not do it for him. I am to consult
 with his agent, Mr. Guerin, about it.”

    [332] John, 2nd Duke of Montagu, born 1705, died 1749; married
    Mary, fourth daughter of Duke of Marlborough.

The regiment was probably the 2nd Horse, which the duke then commanded.
The duke was a relation of Mr. Montagu’s, both being descended from a
common ancestor.

[Page heading: A WET-NURSE]

Writing to Sarah Robinson, Elizabeth says--

 “Your nephew continues his manlike behaviour, and scorns to weep
 over a trifle, he is quite well, and has been dancing in his shirt
 on a blanket spread on the ground, he dances after a droll manner,
 for not being very firm on his legs he reels about when he gets out
 of his common pace, and he flourishes his hands and legs, and is
 just a little merry drunken Bacchus.”

Mrs. Kennet, the wet-nurse, was about returning to her farmer husband
in Kent--

 “Mrs. Kennet will soon be restored to her husband. We are to make
 up her salary to £50. I have given her a good deal of cloaths too,
 the brown silk night gown, a brown camblet, two short cotton gowns,
 and I have dyed my purple Tabby blue, and added two yards of new to
 it, which will make her fine.”

[Page heading: APRONS]

The first mention is made in this letter of Mrs. Dettemere, of whom
more anon. This poor woman appears to have been in a good position of
life, and well known to the Robinsons, but unhappy circumstances had
placed her in great distress. Mrs. Montagu says--

 “I have collected 3 guineas for her, and put her on a scheme of
 working blonde caps. I sold one for her for 7_s._ 6_d._ that cost
 her only 18_d._... I am to lend her £5 to lay out in ribbons,
 and get her customers, and she is to work muslin aprons which
 I will find the materials for, and when she sells them I am to
 be repaid.... I wish you would devise a pattern of sprigs for an
 apron for Mrs. Dettemere to work, I dare not let her have the same
 as Mrs. Medows’[333] apron, but I think to get one of monkeys and
 squirrels.”

    [333] Mr. Montagu’s sister.

Writing to Mrs. Donnellan on June 7, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “The country is now extremely delightful, all nature is in bloom,
 every being joyous and happy, it seems to me impossible that any
 citizen of so fair a world should harbour any gloomy care in their
 breast. It is a vain pretence we make to delicacy and taste, while
 we prefer a dirty town to the country in the fine Season: all
 the arts of luxury cannot invent any pleasures equal to what one
 receives from soft air, moderate sunshine, a gay scene of prospect
 and the musick of the feather’d songsters. Sir William Temple[334]
 says his three wishes were, ‘health, peace and fair weather.’ I
 have often thought that saying not the least wise of many of his
 admired sentences.”

    [334] Sir William Temple, born 1628, died 1699, at Moor Park,
    Surrey. Patron of Swift and his “Stella.”

Mr. Carter, the faithful north-country agent, was now at Sandleford,
and on June 15 Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister, who was staying at
Chilston in Kent with the Thomas Bests. Mr. Best had married Caroline,
_alias_ “Cally,” Scott, of Scott’s Hall, the intimate friend of both
sisters. A most happy marriage it appears to have been--

 “Your nephew is really a droll fellow. Mr. Carter is half bewitched
 with him, at the first salutation ‘Old Trusty’[335] had tears of
 joy, he cries out ‘Bonnie Bairn, ye are a fine one, weel worth it,
 weel worth it, I warrant hee’s think of me when I be dead and
 gone, I’se make all t’improvements I can for him. Thank God he’s
 have a bonnie estate when all comes in; God send him to live to an
 ould man: oh my lady he’s brave company. God’s blessing light on
 him,’ thus he ran on for an hour. The child grew immediately fond
 of him, cries after him, and will beat away even the nurse, if she
 takes him away from Mr. Carter.”

    [335] A nickname of Mr. Carter’s.

[Page heading: ORANGE TREES]

The Duchess of Portland had promised to give a dozen orange trees
from Bullstrode to Mrs. Montagu, which she was most anxious to have.
These trees were to be sent to the Red Lyon at Slough, where the
Newbury carrier was to take them up. They arrived, after the following
vicissitudes, safely:--

 “The poor waggoner who was to have brought them was unhappily
 killed some days ago by a loaded waggon falling on him; his servant
 foolishly left the orange trees because he said he had no room for
 them, and at 9 o’clock at night they brought us word the orange
 trees were left at Slough. We immediately sent servants with a
 cart who travelled almost all night, and brought the trees safe,
 the next day. They have not received the least damage, they are
 blooming, full of fragrance,” says Mrs. Montagu in her letter of
 thanks. She also asks for Mr. Achard to instruct her as to their
 culture, “whether they should be nailed to the wall, without
 pruning their heads, and thirdly what size the tubs should be for
 those that are to be kept in that manner.”

Mr. Achard’s instructions were sent, but alas! are lost.

Mr. Montagu being obliged to go to the North to attend to business of
his own, and as trustee to Mr. Rogers, Mrs. Montagu had determined on
accompanying him and taking “Punch” and her sister Sarah with them.
It was with some difficulty she obtained leave of her parents for her
sister’s company, as they considered she had been so much away from
them. Sarah was desired not to come in the stage-coach from Horton, but
by a post-chaise or chariot at Mrs. Montagu’s expense, and

 “ask Matt to lend you his footman to ride by the chaise. You know
 it will only cost you 3_d._ a mile more.

 “Your nephew has just had his pink sattin coat tryed on, and he was
 so fond of it, he scolded and fought every one who approached him,
 lest they should deprive him of his new cloaths. He has just learnt
 to make a bow with a good grace, and he is very lavish of it.”

[Page heading: ADMIRAL ANSON]

Mrs. Donnellan writes from Hampstead, where she has taken lodgings for
her health, on July 4, and she describes Admiral Anson’s[336] booty
being taken to the bank thus--

 “I went yesterday morning to London, I found all my folks gone to
 see the show of Anson’s wealth carried to the Bank, so I went to my
 Lord Egmont’s[337] and saw two and thirty dirty waggons pass by,
 guarded by a number of tanned sailors, but we had the pleasure of
 knowing or thinking those dirty waggons contained what makes all
 the pursuits of this world....

 “The Duke and Duchess of Portland staid a day longer than they
 designed to see this Show. The King and all the royal family were
 spectators. The Tars were very happy and dressed themselves in the
 Spanyards’ fine cloaths.”

    [336] Admiral Lord Anson, born 1697, died 1762.

    [337] 1st Earl Egmont, a relation of Mrs. Donnellan’s stepfather.

Commodore Anson had been absent from England three years and nine
months. He had intercepted a Spanish treasure ship, _Neustra Signora
de Cabodonga_, loaded with treasure, etc., to the value of £313,100
sterling![338]

    [338] Altogether he obtained £500,000.

Mrs. Donnellan continues--

 “I have not yet heard from Mrs. Delany from Ireland. They were
 stopped at Chester by the Dean’s having a return of ague, so you
 see though a fine preferment may cure, it cannot preserve from
 future evils. The yacht was ready and they hoped to sail the next
 morning.”

[Page heading: CLOTHES]

Lord Carteret had just made Dr. Delany, Dean of Down. Sarah Robinson
was to stay in Dover Street a few days to prepare for her northern
journey before joining the Montagus at Sandleford, and Mrs. Montagu
gives her many commissions--

 “Mr. Montagu desires you would be so kind as to buy him a purple
 tabby for a wastecoat, and a handsome gold lace to trim it; he
 has got a pretty Coventry stuff coat making up here, and would
 have a purple tabby wastecoat to wear with it; please to consult
 Morris[339] both as to the quantity of silk and lace necessary,
 and also what kind of buttons would be proper.... Get pink sattin
 enough for a pair of shoes for your nephew, for he wants a pair of
 shoes for his silk coat: get me coarse canvass for the two little
 armchairs in the dining room in Dover Street, and buy me shades in
 purple worsted to do them in Irish stitch in squares, there must be
 some white Thrum for a stitch in each square. I should be glad if
 you would buy me a pink French paste cross and earrings, the best
 you can get at Chenevix.”[340]

After ordering some table linen to be brought,

 “six table cloaths, three dozen napkins, two pair of sheets, 4 pair
 of Pillibers,[341] my gold lutestring gown, and my white sack with
 the flowers, and a gold handkerchief, my new hoop please pack up.
 Pack up paper of all sorts and sizes enough for all our use, and
 also wax, you will find a stationer’s shop in my cabinet of which I
 sent you the key. Bring a stick of wax for your nephew.”

    [339] Her brother, Morris Robinson.

    [340] Mrs. Chenevix’s celebrated fancy-shop.

    [341] Evidently means pillow-cases.

In a letter to Dr. Freind, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “‘Punch’ is a fine fellow, he is greatly improved since you last
 saw him, he is now an admirable tumbler, I lay him down on a
 blanket on the ground every morning before he is dressed, and at
 night when he is stripped, and there he rolls and tumbles about to
 his great delight.”

Alas! the mother’s joy was turned to grief, for in a few days after,
Punch cut his first tooth with great difficulty and severe illness.

They set out on their journey to the North on July 31, when they
started _viâ_ Oxford, stopping at the Blue Boar there.

[Page heading: MR. JAMES MONTAGU]

[Page heading: CAMBRIDGE AND STOWE]

The following letter to the Duchess of Portland was written from
Newbold Verdon, Mr. James Montagu’s seat in Leicestershire. He was the
elder half-brother of Mr. Montagu by Mr. Charles Montagu’s first wife,
Elizabeth Forster, daughter of Sir James William Forster, of Bamborough
Castle, Northumberland. Newbold Verdon had been left to Mr. James
Montagu by his uncle by marriage, Nathaniel, Baron Crewe of Stene, who
married Dorothy Forster.

  “Newbold Verdon, August 9, 1744.

  “MADAM,

 “I did not set out on my journey so soon as we proposed; the letter
 we sent to my brother Montagu having made the tour of England
 before it reached him, so we waited for an answer. The 31st of July
 we set out for Oxford, where we spent an agreeable day in seeing
 new objects and old friends. The good people from Witney[342] were
 so kind as to come over to see us, and show us what was best worthy
 our attention. The University, I think, is finer than Cambridge,
 but does not excel so much as I had imagined. Alma Mater, however,
 presides in great dignity there. I had hoped to have seen Mr.
 Potts,[343] but was informed he was at Bullstrode, or I should have
 sent to have begged the favour of seeing him.

 “The mighty Shaw[344] had left the classic ground to take care
 of his glebe in the country. The first of August we went to
 Stowe,[345] which is beyond description, it gives the best idea
 of Paradise that can be; even Milton’s images and descriptions
 fall short of it, and indeed a Paradise it must be to every mind
 in a state of innocence. Without the soul’s sunshine every object
 is dark, but a contented mind must feel the most ‘sober certainty
 of waking bliss.’ The buildings[346] are indeed in themselves
 disagreeably crowded, but being dedicated to Patriots, Heroes,
 Lawgivers and Poets, men of ingenuity and invention, they receive
 a dignity from the persons to whom they are consecrated. Others
 that are sacred to imaginary powers, raise pleasing enthusiasm
 in the mind. What different ideas arise in a walk in Kensington
 Gardens, or the Mall, where almost every face wears impertinence,
 the greater part of them unknown, and those whom we are acquainted
 with, only discover to us that they are idle, foolish, vain and
 proud. At Stowe you walk amidst Heroes and Deities, powers and
 persons whom we have been taught to honour, who have embellished
 the world with arts, or instructed it in Science, defended their
 country and improved it. The Temples that pleased me most for the
 design to which they were consecrated, were those to ‘Ancient
 Virtue,’[347] to ‘Friendship,’[348] and to ‘Liberty.’

 “On Saturday last we arrived at my brother Montagu’s, who has made
 this place one of the most charming and pleasant I ever saw: the
 gardens are delightful, the park very beautiful, the house neat
 and agreeable, and everything about it in an elegant taste. My
 brother has made great improvements. It was a very bad place when
 Lord Crewe left it to him, and had no ornament but fine wood; now
 there is water in great beauty, grand avenues from every point,
 fine young plantations, and in short, everything that can please
 the eye. But nothing gives me so much pleasure as the obliging and
 friendly reception of the Master, who has entertained us in a kind
 and elegant and magnificent manner. The regularity and order of the
 family, and the happiness that appears in the countenance of every
 friend and servant, gives one pleasure to observe it....

  “I am, Madam,
  “Your Grace’s most obedient,
  Humble servant,
  “E. MONTAGU.”

    [342] The Rev. Dr. Freind and wife.

    [343] Frequent mention is made of Potts in the letter, but no clue
    as to who he was.

    [344] Dr. Thomas Shaw, divine and antiquary, also conchologist,
    born 1692, died 1751.

    [345] Stowe in Buckinghamshire, the magnificent seat of Viscount
    Cobham.

    [346] Alluding to numerous temples and monuments in the gardens.

    [347] In this are the statues of Greek sages, by Scheemackers.

    [348] Erected by Lord Cobham for busts of his political friends.

[Page heading: NEWBOLD VERDON]

After leaving Newbold Verdon, the Montagus went over Thoresby, the
seat of the Duke of Kingston.[349] In a letter to Mrs. Freind from
Allerthorpe, where the Montagus had arrived on August 16, Thoresby is
thus described--

 “A fine place enough, but does not deserve what is said of it;
 the cascade is not pretty, it is regular and formal. The lake
 from which it is supplied is fine. The verdure of the park is not
 good, nor are there fine trees. Our last stage was to York, where
 we saw the Assembly Room[350] built by Lord Burlington, it is
 prodigiously grand and beautiful.”

    [349] The 2nd Duke of Kingston, called by Sir Horace Walpole
    “a very weak man, of the greatest beauty, and finest person in
    England.”

    [350] Designed by Richard, 3rd Earl of Burlington, celebrated as an
    amateur architect. He built Burlington House.

[Page heading: “PUNCH’S” DEATH]

In a letter to the Duchess of Portland of August 19, Mrs. Montagu said
her boy had borne the journey well, and was “quite well.” She intended
to leave him in Mrs. Carter’s care whilst she accompanied Mr. Montagu
to Newcastle, where the air was not healthy, and roads very bad. Alas!
a few days after, poor little “Punch,” in cutting another tooth, was
taken with convulsion fits and died. The exact date I am unaware of.
Lodge, in his “Peerage of Irish Peers,” states he died on August 17,
and was buried at Burneston.[351] The date of the day is wrong, as will
be perceived by her letter to the duchess. My grandfather simply states
he died of convulsion fits, occasioned by teething, no date; but as
Mrs. Freind wrote to condole with Mrs. Montagu on September 3, it must
have happened soon after her letter to the duchess. As no parents, from
their letters, could have adored an infant more than the Montagus, it
may be judged what a blow this was to them. Many sweet passages about
this child have I suppressed from want of space. He seems to have been
of a too precocious nature in mind and body. He was so large he wore
shoes big enough for a child of four. He ran alone and talked, and
mimicked people’s manners and ways, and was only one year and three
months old! “Our little cherub,” “our sweet angel,” as his father
constantly writes of him. The noble way in which both his parents
supported their anguish will be seen by future extracts from letters.
Dr. Freind’s fine letter of condolence to Mrs. Montagu is indorsed at
the back, “Letter from Dr. Freind on the unhappy loss of my son,”
and is much worn with constant reading. He had lost two children, and
was then threatened with the loss of his father,[352] whom he adored.
The poor Montagus, much as they desired children, never had any more.
I sometimes think that this poignant and irrevocable loss turned
Elizabeth Montagu’s thoughts more strongly to literature and knowledge
of all kind. She sought to occupy her mind as a solace for grief, but
she never forgot her loss, and every now and then the bitterness of it
is shown in passages in her letters.

    [351] His body was moved to Winchester Cathedral eventually, and is
    buried with his father and mother there, by her will in October,
    1800.

    [352] The Rev. Dr. Robert Freind, died August 9, 1751.

[Page heading: THE LOSS OF AN ONLY CHILD]

The Duchess of Portland writes on September 7, 1744--

  “MY DEAREST AND MOST AMIABLE OF FRIENDS,

 “Could I have thought I should have given you a moment’s relief or
 abated the anguish of your affliction, I should before now have
 written to you, but I found myself too much affected to be able
 to say anything to lessen it. Thank God, my dear Friend, your
 Health is good, my dependence is upon your good understanding and
 submission to the Divine Will, for no one can have a higher idea
 of the Deity than I know you have. Everything is in His disposal,
 our blessings, and our afflictions, and He never chastises us
 above what we are able to bear. This affliction would have been
 still more grievous had you been out of the way.[353] You might
 have thought some neglect had been the cause, which now you
 are convinced was not in the power of Human Means. There is no
 misfortune but what God Almighty discovers His mercy in some means
 or other, even in our most bitter calamities. But why should I
 tell you this, that know and think so much better than I can do?
 It is a great comfort to me that you are well, and I hope you will
 endeavour to keep so. Miss Robinson has been most excessively
 kind in giving me such frequent accounts of you, for which I shall
 ever esteem her, and be her most humble, grateful servant.... What
 would I give to be with you, my dear Friend, that you might pour
 out your whole heart, and utter all your grief, but it is never in
 my power to be of any service to those I love. Adieu, God bless
 and preserve you from any future ill, but that He may heap many
 blessings on you is the ardent wish of one that entirely loves you
 with the utmost fidelity and will ever be yours.”

    [353] This shows Mrs. Montagu was not away at the time of her
    child’s death.

[Page heading: SUBMISSION TO GOD’S WILL]

To this letter Mrs. Montagu replied--

  “Allerthorpe, September 16, 1744.

 “I am much obliged to my dear Friend for her tender concern for
 me; I would have wrote to you before, but I could not command my
 thoughts so as to write what might be understood. I am well enough
 as to health of Body, but God knows the sickness of the soul is far
 worse. However, as so many good friends interest themselves for me,
 I am glad I am not ill. I know it is my duty to be resigned and to
 submit; many far more deserving than I am have been as unfortunate.
 I hope time will bring me comfort. I will assist it with my best
 endeavours; it is in affliction like mine that reason ought to
 exert itself else one should fall beneath the stroke. I apply
 myself to reading as much as I can, and I find it does me service.
 Poor Mr. Montagu shows me an example of patience and fortitude,
 and endeavours to comfort me, though undoubtedly he feels as much
 sorrow as I can do, for he loved his child as much as ever parent
 could do. My sister has been of great service to me; and on this,
 as on all other occasions, a most tender friend. I am much obliged
 to you for wishing yourself with so unhappy a companion: your
 conversation would be a cordial to my spirits, but I should be
 afraid of being otherwise to yours. Adieu, think of me as seldom as
 you can, and when you do, remember I am patient, and hope that the
 same Providence that snatched this sweetest blessing from me, may
 give me others, if not I will endeavour to be content, if I may not
 be happy. Heaven preserve you and your dear precious Babes; thank
 God you are far removed from my misfortune, and can hardly fear to
 be bereft of all.[354]

  “I am, ever your Grace’s most affectionate
  “E. M.”

    [354] The duchess then had five children alive.

[Page heading: A BROTHER’S SYMPATHY]

Lady Andover wrote from Charlton, Wilts, “by Highworth Bag,” to condole
with her friend. In this letter she mentions that her friend, Lydia
Botham (Mrs. Laurence Sterne’s sister), had nearly died at the birth
of a daughter (Catherine), but was better. Matthew Robinson wrote and
implored his sister to accompany her husband to Newcastle. He says,
“Books and thought are the food of melancholy, and lovely places,
however beautiful, the dwellings of it, but a town entirely strange to
you, and new company, would bid fairest to dissipate your thoughts.” He
signs himself “Matthew Robinson Morris,” having adopted the latter, the
maiden name of his mother, as her heir to the Mount Morris and Monk’s
Horton estates. Mrs. Donnellan, writing from Bullstrode on September
24, mentions, “I have brought down a screen to work in snail for the
Duchess, and for my retired hours, Carte’s[355] History to read, for
Sir Paul Davis, who is a chief actor, was my great-grandfather.”

    [355] The Rev. Thomas Carte, born 1686, died 1754. Chaplain to
    Bishop Atterbury.

No further letters do I possess till October 23, when Mrs. Montagu
writes to the duchess and states Mr. Montagu had started riding to
London on particular business. He hated wheels, and always preferred
riding. Mrs. Montagu and Sarah had been prevailed on to visit Mrs.
Yorke at Richmond in his absence.

The great Duchess of Marlborough’s death, which had just occurred on
October 18, is commented on thus--

 “How are the mighty fallen! Oh vanity of Human things! the Duchess
 of Marlborough is now not worth a groat, nor does pride glow any
 longer in old Granville’s heart. The old Countess[356] had reckoned
 with pleasure the riches Mrs. Spencer[357] was to possess, and no
 doubt pleased herself with the hopes of seeing it, little imagining
 Clotho had twisted their line of life together.”

    [356] The Countess of Granville, died October 27, 1744.

    [357] Hon. John Spencer was grandson of the Duchess of Marlborough,
    married to the daughter of the Countess of Granville.

[Page heading: A RAREE SHOW]

Whilst staying with Mrs. Yorke, Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess--

 “Your Grace may not think we have any publick diversions at
 Richmond. I must assure you we went to a fine Raree Show.[358] An
 orrery made up some part of it, and gave a dignity to the whole.
 However it was an emblem of life, the first scene was all gay
 figures and dogs and Ducks and Horses and Coaches, and every object
 was new and striking: then came Mademoiselle Catherina with all the
 airs of a celebrated toast, turned her head about with a measured
 grace, smiled, curtseyed, and flirted her fan: when everyone had
 enough of that, we went to study the world. We observed its motion,
 saw the revolution of a few years, and while we rather admired
 than understood its movements, were almost weary and yet loath to
 retire, there was presented the figure of Time mowing us all down,
 and so we made our Exit.”

    [358] A show enclosed in a box.

Mrs. Montagu and Sarah set out on their journey to London, and a letter
to the duchess from Northampton, November 17, shows the state of the
roads then--

 “I am here in a whole skin, thanks to the care of our coachman,
 and the stuffing of our coach seats, but never was poor mortal so
 jumbled, jolted and dragged through such roads. I never saw such
 roads in my life as between Harborough and this place. We were
 obliged to come a nameless pace that is slower than a walk. Mr.
 Montagu is to meet us to-morrow, he expected our being at Newport
 to-night, but we did not get to Northampton till after three
 o’clock in the afternoon, though we got into the coach at seven in
 the morning.”

In a letter of November 23 the duchess says, “I have read a sermon of
Swift’s upon the Trinity, which I like extremely, and wish you would
read it, and give me your opinion of it.”

[Page heading: DISEASE IN CATTLE]

At Bullstrode at this time were Lady Wallingford and Miss Granville. On
the same day Mrs. Robinson writes from Mount Morris and congratulates
her daughters on their safe arrival in Dover Street. She mentions the
cattle plague then beginning; thus--

 “Our epidemical distemper is madness, which, thank God, has not yet
 reached the human species, but reigns among horses, cows, hoggs,
 shepp, and doggs; of the latter we have been one out of pocket, but
 our new tenant has lost a cow, and has a ram uncommonly freakish,
 which they suppose is going the same way, and J. Smith a hogg or
 two, and the country people take so little care of their doggs when
 they are bitt, as is very injurious to their neighbours. Ours was
 a greyhound, which will prevent Mr. Robinson’s coursing till he
 recruits his loss with another.”

Poor Mrs. Robinson, only three weeks after this letter, wrote to her
daughters to say she had a swelling in her breast, which had formed
some ten weeks back, and which she had hitherto concealed, and feared
was cancer. She wrote to Dr. Chesilden,[359] the famous surgeon, to
tell him, and he desired her to come to town.

    [359] Dr. William Chesilden, born 1688, died 1752.

[Page heading: MRS. ROBINSON’S ILLNESS]

Mrs. Montagu writes on December 17 to the duchess in great distress--

 “that it was a cancer, but that not sticking to the ribs, it may
 be taken out without danger; he (Dr. Chesilden) has behaved to her
 with great gentleness and care, and has made her very easy. She
 bears her misfortune with great fortitude, she is neither afraid of
 death or pain, but says she is contented to suffer what Providence
 pleases to ordain.... She will not suffer us to be in the house
 while the operation is performed. They assure us there is no danger
 of her Life, but it is terrible to think of the pain she must
 undergo.”

The operation was performed successfully, but must have been shocking
to bear, the use of anæsthetics not being then known. The two daughters
nursed their mother, and the affectionate Mrs. Donnellan assisted,
though herself in great trouble at the ill-health of her stepfather,
Mr. Perceval. On Christmas Day, Mrs. Montagu writes a good report to
the duchess, whose London porter, Elias, called daily to inquire. In
the letter mention is made of “Marshall Belleisle[360] being taken
prisoner, as he was going to the King of Prussia. His papers and
attendants all seized.”

    [360] Duc de Belle-Isle, French Marshal; born 1684, died 1761.

Thus end the letters of 1744.




CHAPTER VI.

1745--AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS--LETTERS FROM MR. MONTAGU AND OTHERS ABOUT THE
JACOBITE CAMPAIGN.


[Year: 1745]

The first letter of any interest in 1745 is from Mrs. Robinson to Mrs.
Montagu, dated May 8. In this she alludes to the death of the second
Mrs. Conyers Middleton, _née_ Miss Place, who had died on April 26, in
her thirty-eighth year. It appears the marriage had not been a very
happy one. Mrs. Robinson remarks--

 “The Dean of Canterbury hears the Doctor (Middleton) is going to
 Ireland with Lord Chesterfield.[361]... I take it for granted, if
 he goes he is to be an Irish Bishop. It is very strange that no one
 can be contented with their present state, for though the Doctor is
 neither great nor rich, he has more than he wants, and can spend
 his time in such studies as he chuses, and his vacant hours in the
 company he has been used to, which I think to one between 60 and
 70, would be no small consideration.”

    [361] The 4th Earl of Chesterfield, born 1694, died 1773. He was
    just made Viceroy of Ireland.

[Page heading: DONNINGTON CASTLE]

A letter of July 24 from Mrs. Montagu at Sandleford to the Duchess
of Portland gives an interesting account of Donnington Castle, near
Newbury--

 “One day this week we rode to Chaucer’s Castle,[362] where you
 will suppose we made some verses no doubt, and when they showed us
 Chaucer’s well, I desired some Helicon, hoping thereby to write
 you a more poetical letter, but the place having been, during the
 last Civil War, besieged, the Muses were frightened away, and
 forbade this spring to flow, so it is entirely choaked up, and
 where flourished Laurels and Bays, grows only uncouth thorns and
 thistles. Where erst the Muses and the Graces played in the best
 room of the Castle, now stink a few tame partridges: in short, the
 present owner, having none of the divine enthusiasm of poetry, has
 turned the Castle to barbarous uses. Above it is a partridge Mew,
 below a court is kept for paying fines and fees.”

    [362] Donnington belonged to Thomas Chaucer, son of the poet, but
    likely enough the father visited his son there.

Mrs. Montagu had been far from well this spring and summer, with
lowness of spirits and nervous fainting attacks. Dr. Mead prescribed
riding as a remedy, and finally advised her to take the waters at
Tunbridge Wells. Mr. Montagu being obliged to go to the North about his
own and Mr. Rogers’ affairs, it was agreed that she should drink the
waters whilst he was absent.

Lady Wallingford, who had been paying them a long visit, set out for
Bath. Mrs. Montagu left Sandleford, August 18, for London, with Mr.
Montagu, and left for Tunbridge Wells on the 20th, Mr. Montagu leaving
for the North on August 29.

[Page heading: DR. YOUNG AND CIBBER!]

Writing from Tunbridge Wells to the Duchess of Portland on August 27,
Mrs. Montagu says--

 “I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I disturbed in a reverie, and
 at first he started, then bowed, then fell back into a surprise,
 then began a speech, relapsed into his astonishment two or three
 times.... I told him your Grace desired he would write longer
 letters, to which he cried “Ha!” most emphatically, and I leave
 you to interpret what it meant. He has made a friendship with
 one person here, whom I believe you would not imagine to have
 been made for his bosom friend.... You would not guess that this
 associate of the Doctor’s was old _Cibber_![363] Certainly in their
 religious, moral and civil character there is no relation, but in
 their Dramatic capacity there is some. But why the Reverend Divine
 and serious author of the melancholy ‘Night Thoughts’ should desire
 to appear as a _persona dramatis_ here, I cannot imagine. The
 waters have raised his spirits to a fine pitch, as your Grace will
 imagine when I tell you how sublime an answer he made to a very
 vulgar question. I asked him how long he staid at the Wells? He
 said ‘as long as my rival staid!’ I was astonished how one who made
 no pretensions to anything could have a rival, so I asked him for
 an explanation: he said he would stay as long as the _Sun_ did!”

    [363] Colley Cibber, actor and dramatist, born 1671, died 1757.

On August 30, writing to Mr. Montagu, mention is made of Dr. Smith, his
friend, being at Tunbridge Wells. Dr. Robert Smith[364] was Master of
Trinity, Cambridge, a mathematician and professor of astronomy, and had
been tutor to the Duke of Cumberland.

 “He sat next me at the Concert last night; why he is so fond
 of this place, I cannot tell, for it seems not very agreeable
 to the nature of a Philosopher. This is a life of idleness and
 dissipation. I spend great part of my day at home, but most people
 live upon the Publick Walks. I have got up very early and generally
 read an hour before I go to the Well. The greatest pleasure I have
 here is riding about to see this wild, rude country. Dr. Young
 dined with me to-day. Dr. Audley was much pleased with him, and we
 had a very chearful meal.”

    [364] Dr. Robert Smith, born 1681, died 1768.

Mr. Montagu desired much to see some wheatears, birds that abound in
the Downs still, and are delicious eating.

 “I was sorry the Wheatears could not be got, but the Poulterer
 disappointed me; however I have now got a couple stuffed, by which
 you will see their shape and feathers.

 “It is now absolutely said the Duchess of Manchester[365] is to
 marry Mr. Hussey.”[366]

    [365] Isabella, daughter of the Duke of Montagu, and widow of 2nd
    Earl of Manchester.

    [366] Mr. Edward Hussey, afterwards Earl of Beaulieu.

Mr. Montagu writes from his brother’s place, Newbold Verdon, where he
stayed _en route_ to the North--

 “At Dunstable Hill j met Mr. Stanhope with your friend Dr.
 Courayer, and not far from Northampton my Lady Halifax[367] going
 to London to lye in, and afterwards my Lord,[368] with whom j
 had some discourse, and who was so civil as to say he hoped j
 intended calling on him at Horton. I said j would take some other
 opportunity of paying my respects. We had yesterday the company of
 Lord Wentworth[369] and a brother[370] of the great Mr. Lyttelton,
 who is a Clergyman, at dinner. The former of whom is a very pretty
 kind of man, and the other will be a Bishop.”

    [367] _Née_ Anne Dunk, a great heiress.

    [368] George Montagu Dunk, 5th Earl of Halifax.

    [369] Edward, 9th Baron Wentworth.

    [370] Charles Lyttelton, afterwards Bishop of Carlisle.

[Page heading: DERBY]

Arrived at Derby, Mr. Montagu writes, “The town is finely situated, and
the country good about it, but the famous engine[371] for silk weaving
being out of order, j am afraid we must go away without seeing it.”

    [371] Invented by Mr. John Lombe, one great wheel turning 99,947
    smaller wheels!

[Page heading: MANCHESTER]

On September 5 Mr. Montagu writes from Manchester--

 “We lay last night at Buxton, which is a mean town, very romantic
 and surrounded with barren hills, and this morning, after
 travelling over about ten miles of very hilly country, some of
 which afforded very delightful prospects, and about 12 miles over
 a rich, flat country, we came here. This town is in the general,
 old, but some good houses have been built, and are daily building.
 The Collegiate Church is very handsome. It is very populous, and
 contains, as they say, about 70,000 people, and drives a prodigious
 trade.

 “To-morrow we pursue our journey. We propose to lye at Skipton in
 Craven, which if we do, we shall reach Burton in good time the next
 day.”

Burton was Mr. Buckley’s[372] home.

    [372] With whom the three younger Robinson boys had lived.

We must now return to Mrs. Montagu. Tunbridge Wells agreed with her,
her spirits mended, and to the duchess’s inquiries she states--

 “I can eat more buttered roll in a morning than a great girl at
 a boarding school, and more beef at dinner than a yeoman of the
 Guards; I sleep well, and am indeed in perfect health, and the
 waters have done me much service.”

[Page heading: DR. YOUNG]

With Dr. Young’s company she was delighted, and she rode with him
often. One ride she describes thus--

 “I have been in the vapours these two days, on account of Dr.
 Young’s leaving us: he was so good as to let me have his company
 very often, and we used to ride and walk and take sweet counsel
 together. A few days before he went away, he carried Mrs. Rolt[373]
 and myself to Tunbridge,[374] five miles from hence, where we were
 to see some fine ruins.... First rode the Doctor on a tall steed,
 decently caparizoned in grey; next ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney
 horse lean as the famed Rosinante, but in shape much resembling
 Sancho’s ass; then followed your humble servant on a milk white
 Palfrey, whose reverence for the human kind induced him to be
 governed by a creature not half as strong and I fear scarce thrice
 as wise as himself. The two figures that brought up the rear, the
 first was my servant valiantly armed with two uncharged pistols,
 whose holsters were covered with two civil harmless monsters, that
 signified the valour and courtesy of our ancestors. The last was
 the Doctor’s man, whose uncombed hair so resembled the mane of the
 horse he rode on, one could not help imagining they were of him....
 On his head was a velvet cap much resembling a black saucepan,
 and on his side hung a little basket. Thus did we ride, or rather
 jog on to Tunbridge town. To tell you how the dogs barked at us,
 the children squalled, and the men and women stared at us, would
 take too much time.... At last we arrived at the ‘King’s Head’:
 the loyalty of the Doctor induced him to alight.... We took this
 progress to see the ruins of an old Castle; but first our Divine
 would visit the Churchyard, where we read that folks were born
 and died, the natural, moral, and physical history of Mankind.
 In the Churchyard grazed the Parson’s Steed, whose back was worn
 bare with carrying a pillion Seat for the comely, fat personage,
 this ecclesiastic’s wife. Though the creature eat daily part of
 the parish, he was most miserably lean. Tired of dead and living
 bones, Mrs. Rolt and I jumped over a stile into the Parson’s field,
 and from thence, allured by the sight of golden Pippins, we made
 an attempt to break into the holy man’s orchard. He came most
 courteously to us and invited us to his apple-trees; to show our
 moderation we each of us gathered two mellow codlings....

 “The good parson offered to show us the inside of his Church, but
 made some apology for his undress, which was a truly canonical
 dishabille. He had on a grey striped calamanco night gown, a wig
 that once was white, but by the influence of an uncertain climate
 turned to a pale orange, a brown hat, encompassed by a black
 hatband, a band somewhat dirty that decently retired under his
 chin, a pair of grey stockings well mended with blue worsted,
 strong symbol of the conjugal care and affection of his wife,
 who had mended his hose with the very worsted she bought for her
 own.... When we had seen the Church, the parson invited us to take
 some refreshment, but Dr. Young thought we had before trespassed
 on the good man’s time, so desired to be excused, else we should,
 no doubt, have been welcomed to the house by Madam in her muslin
 pinners and sarsenet hood, who would have given some Mead and a
 piece of a cake that she made in the Whitsun holidays for her
 cousins.”

    [373] Mrs. Rolt, a friend of Dr. Conyers Middleton.

    [374] Tunbridge and Tunbridge Wells are separate towns.

[Page heading: TONBRIDGE CASTLE]

Mrs. Montagu goes on to say they invited the divine to join them
at dinner, which he refused, but appeared afterwards with a large
tobacco-horn, with Queen Anne’s head upon it, peeping from his pocket.

 “After dinner we walked to the old Castle,[375] which was built by
 Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, in William Rufus’ days. It
 has been a most magnificent building, the situation is extremely
 beautiful: the Castle made a kind of half moon down to the river,
 and where the river does not defend it, it is guarded by a large
 moat. The towers at the great Gate are covered with fine venerable
 ivy. It was late in the evening before we got home, but the silver
 Cynthia held up her lamp in the heavens, and cast such a light on
 the earth, as showed its beauties in a soft and gentle light. The
 night silenced all but our Divine Doctor, who sometimes uttered
 things fit to be spoken in a Season when all Nature seems to be
 hushed and hearkening. I followed gathering wisdom as I went, till
 I found by my horse’s stumbling that I was in a bad road, and that
 the blind was leading the blind: so I placed my servant between
 the Doctor and myself, which he not perceiving, went on in a most
 philosophical strain to the great amazement of my poor clown of
 a servant, who not being brought up to any pitch of enthusiasm,
 nor making answer to any of the fine things he heard, the Doctor
 wondering I was dumb, and grieving I was so stupid, looked round,
 declared his surprise, and desired the man to trot on before.”

    [375] William Rufus gave Tonbridge to Richard FitzGilbert, ancestor
    of the Earls of Clare, surnamed “De Benefacta.”

[Page heading: THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ’45]

Not till a letter of Mr. Montagu’s of September 17, from Allerthorpe,
is a word said of the rising in Scotland. This passage occurs--

 “The affair of the Pretender has made a noise beyond what j at
 first imagined it would. If it is as formidable as some would have
 us believe it to be, j hope by the care and vigilance of those at
 the helm, it will be soon crushed. We are hitherto in this country
 very quiet, and j hope we shall keep so.”

The next letter of September 22 says--

 “I intended being at Newcastle next Tuesday, but what has happened
 since has made that impossible, for on Tuesday there is to be a
 meeting of the gentlemen at York, at which Mr. Carter and j are to
 be there.

 “The rebels have certainly entered the city of Edinburgh,[376]
 as j suppose by the treachery of some there, but as the town of
 Newcastle has taken proper precautions and that there are at that
 town 1700 men, besides 1200 at Durham, and j hope with Cope are
 computed 3000, and it is said that the Dutch transports have been
 seen off the coasts, j hope there is no doubt this rebellion will
 be crushed. I hope, however, you will be under as little concern
 as possible, for j will run myself into no unnecessary danger, but
 behave as j hope you, if you were upon the spot, would approve.”

    [376] They entered Edinburgh on September 16.

[Page heading: GEORGE LEWIS SCOTT]

[Page heading: NATIONAL TERRORS]

This letter frightened Mrs. Montagu much. She immediately wrote to
propose joining Mr. Montagu, and despatched a messenger to London to
ask advice from a person likely to know about the affair. This person
was Mr. George Lewis Scott,[377] eldest son of George Scott, of Bristo
in Scotland, by Marion Stewart, daughter of Sir James Stewart, Lord
Advocate of Scotland. He was a great friend of George I., and had his
names given to him by the Princess Sophia,[378] who was his godmother.
He was a most able mathematician, which formed a tie between himself
and Mr. Montagu. He was a tall, big man, very sociable and facetious,
an accomplished musician. In 1750 he was Sub-Preceptor to George III.,
and in 1756 Commissioner of Excise. I give a portion of his letter in
reply; his handwriting is beautiful--

 “Hearing of an express said to arrive last night, I went out in
 search of news, but find nothing material since the account of
 the unhappy battle,[379] or rather infamous flight, of Saturday
 last. We have as yet no authentic detail of the action. The common
 opinion is, that the King’s forces both horse and foot behaved
 scandalously. Inclosed I send you a list of some officers killed
 and wounded in this affair. We do not yet know what is become of
 the rest, excepting that the greatest part of the Dragoons were
 safe at Berwick with Sir John Cope.[380] The Captain Stewart of
 the Earl of Loudoun’s Regiment mentioned among the slain was an
 acquaintance of Mr. Montagu’s, and a great friend of Mr. Spencer’s.
 There are two Captains killed and regretted of Guise’s Regiment,
 the same corps in which my brother has a company. By good fortune
 he was not there, being just returned from Flanders, and this Day
 upon the Establishment as engineer, and ordered to attend Marshal
 Wade. We may once more call the east wind a Protestant wind. Had
 the English and Dutch forces, amounting to 12,000 men, been kept
 off by contrary winds, God only knows what the consequences of the
 loss of this, in itself trifling, skirmish might have been. As
 it is the Stocks have fallen considerably. There has been a run
 upon the Bank, who have paid silver to gain time, and have been
 much blamed for so doing. But on the other hand, just reasons are
 alledged for their conduct. They say they had certain knowledge
 that those who began the run were disaffected persons, who, if
 they had been paid in gold, might with much greater facility have
 transmitted supplies to Scotland, than when paid in silver. However
 this may be, it is certain that some of the most considerable
 Bankers and Merchants have agreed to support the Bank on this
 occasion. I am still hopeful, notwithstanding all the bad rumours
 we hear, that the old English spirit, though confessedly sunk in
 deep slumbers for many years, may yet awake. Can anything be more
 ridiculous and more joyful to the French, more terrible and more
 shameful to ourselves, to see a Nation which might raise 500,000
 men, a nation worth twice 500 millions of property, frightened and
 disordered by 5000 Highland ruffians not worth £5000, if they,
 their wives and children, servants, goods and chattels, were to be
 sold in the market? In the days of Oliver six times that number
 were near Dunbar dispersed by 10,000 English like chaff before the
 wind. But perhaps, as Voltaire says, ‘Les anglois d’aujourd’huy ne
 resemblent aux anglois de Cromwell, non plus que les Monsignori de
 Rome ne resemblent aux Scipions et aux Catons.’”

    [377] George Lewis Scott, born 1708, died 1780.

    [378] Daughter of George I., married Frederick William, King of
    Prussia.

    [379] Battle of Preston Pans, fought on September 20.

    [380] Commander-in-Chief for Scotland.

[Page heading: GENERAL WADE’S ARMY]

The last account we have of the rebels is that

 “they are returned to Edinburgh, and it is supposed they will
 be audacious enough to call a Parliament of that Nation, and
 dissolve the Union. This I think good news, as it will give time
 for the panic, with which too many are seized, to dissipate. It
 will also give the well affected in the Northern counties time
 to arm, and for the King’s forces to assemble. Mr. Wade’s army
 is to be 10 or 12,000 strong. The Rendezvous it’s said, is to be
 at Nottingham. I wish the Duke[381] were sent for to command.
 He behaved incomparably well in Flanders, avoided no danger, no
 fatigue, was an example of regularity and discipline, and what
 is more considerable, of justice in rewarding merit. More troops
 are said to be ordered over. This is certainly a right step, but
 the consequences on the other side of the water, be what they
 will.... We have a report that the Castle of Edinburgh must soon
 surrender for want of provisions. What an unpardonable neglect! If
 this should be so, the consequences would be very bad, as it would
 furnish the rebels with considerable quantities of cash, plate,
 arms, powder, and artillery. What will happen, I know not, but if
 I were Governor, I could soon fetch up provisions from the city by
 bombs and red-hot balls.”

    [381] The Duke of Cumberland, born 1721, died 1768; second son of
    George II.

Mr. Scott concludes his letter by saying he hopes Mr. Montagu will be
in London for the meeting of Parliament on October 17. He also adds--

 “I could wish you further from the Sea-side than Mount Morris,
 though Mr. Vernon[382] is the most vigilant of commanders. I have
 been assured that as soon as the news of his being appointed was
 known in France, the price of insurance was raised.”

    [382] Admiral Vernon, born 1684, died 1757.

He concludes with messages to Sarah Robinson, who was with her sister,
and who was destined to become his wife.

[Page heading: COUNTY MEETING]

[Page heading: CONDUCT OF THE NORTHERN GENTRY]

The next letter from Mr. Montagu from Allerthorpe, dated September 27,
is thus--

  “MY DEAREST,

 “Since my last letter to you by Sunday’s Post, we had our meeting
 at York on Tuesday the 24th, where there was the greatest Meeting
 of peoples of all Ranks and degrees that j believe was ever
 known upon any occasion. Of the nobility there was present the
 Lord Carlisle,[383] the Lord Malton,[384] Lord Lonsdale,[385]
 Lord Falconbridge,[386] Lord Fitzwilliam,[387] and perhaps some
 others who may have escaped my notice, together with Sir Conyers
 D’Arcy,[388] Mr. Turner, Member for the County, Mr. Fox and Mr.
 Wentworth, members for the City of York, and all the gentlemen
 of the County, together with the clergy. There was the utmost
 unanimity and spirit imaginable, and after a meeting at the Castle,
 where the Archbishop made a handsome speech on the occasion, an
 association was entered into with an address to the King, and
 subscription made of near £20,000, and which when the whole of
 the collection shall be made, will j believe amount to much more.
 With this money there are to be raised several Companys of foot,
 consisting of 50 men each, and they will be officered by gentlemen
 who will serve without any pay, among whom is my friend, Sir R.
 Graham, but it will be some time before these companys can be
 raised, and made usefull, which would not have been otherwise,
 if the Militia had been kept up and exercised as the law directs
 instead of being ridiculed and rendered contemptible these
 last fifty years for purposes j need not tell you. I wish this
 misfortune would for the future learn us more prudence, and make
 us settle the Militia which is the only constitutional force, and
 agreeable to our liberty, upon a better footing than it has of late
 been, but j know too much of mankind ever to hope to see it in
 this country. This rebellion has made a most rapid and surprising
 progress. Edinburgh was taken before it was believed there was
 almost any such thing. The disbelief, however, of the people was
 no excuse for the M(inistr)y, whose measures have been the cause
 of it, for not crushing it at the beginning. The conduct of our
 General Cope is much censured for suffering himself to be surprised
 by the enemy, who in a short time overcame, and j wish Wentworth
 who is sent may have better success than he had at Carthagena. Mr.
 Ridley, the Mayor of Newcastle, has taken all proper precautions
 to secure the town, and if we are rightly informed, has, with the
 promise of £10,000, gained all the Keel men, who are computed
 at 15,000 men. The county of Durham has raised the Militia and
 General Oglethorpe[389] is at York raising a regiment of gentlemen
 volunteers. About 15,000 Dutch are j believe got to Berwick, and j
 hope we shall soon have the regiments amounting to upwards of 6000,
 which are lately landed in the Thames from Holland, by means of
 all which force j flatter myself a speedy end will be put to this
 unhappy affair, and peace restored to our Island....

 “I desire you will not let yourself be concerned more than you
 ought at these unhappy times, nor imagine us here in greater
 danger than we really are, for if the enemy should be for coming
 this length, we should have notice enough of it, and as we are
 at present unprovided with force, must take to flight to save
 ourselves. I am in very good health and spirits, and run no hazards
 but what others as deserving and better than j do run, and hope
 your good sense and greatness of mind will preserve you from being
 more concerned than other people are, or you ought to be. I desire
 you will add to all the other testimonys of your love and affection
 to me, what j now ask, which at all events will make me easy. I
 will take all opportunities of writing to you, and am, with my
 compliments to dear Miss Salley,

  “My dearest Angel,
  “Your most affectionate Husband,
  “EDW. MONTAGU.

[Page heading: GENERAL COPE’S DEFEAT]

The next letter from Mr. Montagu is written from Allerthorpe, on
September 29, after having received his wife’s earnest appeal to be
allowed to join him. This sentence shows his affection for her--

 “You have ever been my Pride, j have loved and honoured you with
 the tenderest affection, and will continue to do so as long as j
 live, but j now adore you for the greatness of mind, joyned with
 the utmost regard shewn to me in a letter which might have well
 become a Roman Lady. The happiest days that j ever past in my life,
 have been with you, and j hope Heaven, after these storms shall
 be blown over, will grant me the long enjoyment of your charming
 society, which I prefer above everything upon Earth....

 “I cannot consent to the danger you might run by coming to me,
 however glad j might be to have you with me, but must desire you
 and conjure you without any further difficulty or hesitation to go
 to your Father’s in Kent, where you will be amongst those who best
 love you, and are most capable to defend you, till j can come to
 you there myself....

 “The defeat of Cope is a very great misfortune. Everybody censures
 the conduct of the General, as well as the behaviour of the
 soldiers. We have since the battle heard no more but that the
 Rebels are encamped at Preston Pans, near where the battle was
 fought.”

[Page heading: SUSSEX PRIVATEERS]

On September 30, from London, George Lewis Scott writes to Mrs.
Montagu, still at Tunbridge Wells--

 “Since my last I have seen two Officers, who were in the engagement
 of Saturday sen’night, and I have had a pretty distinct account
 of our dispositions, so that I could send you a plan of that
 affair.... It seems agreed both by these officers and by the
 General’s letter that our men were seized with a panic at the
 rapid motion of the Highlanders, so that their officers attempted
 to rally them in vain. The military Chest and all the baggage
 was taken, what the loss of men is cannot yet be known. I find
 Captain Stewart is not killed, but only taken Prisoner. Our civil
 panic here begins to subside a little. General Wade’s[390] Army
 will probably be near Doncaster by this day sen’night, so that we
 hope Yorkshire will be protected.... We are in no apprehensions
 for Berwick or Newcastle: nor is the Castle of Edinburgh in danger
 for want of provisions. Besides the ordinary Stores, the Governor
 swept all the Markets in town, the day the Rebels left it to meet
 General Cope. The Provost, I hear, is in the Castle, so that I
 hope he will be able to wipe off the aspersions so liberally
 thrown upon him. There is no certain news of the further motions
 or schemes of the Rebels. To-day I was told they intended to march
 for Northumberland, and expected to be there increased 10,000 men
 besides £100,000 in money. I give no great credit to my author’s
 intelligence, he is of a suspected family and speaks as he wishes.
 This is all I have been able to pick up for you, and I hope your
 fears begin to subside a little. But if I endeavour to diminish
 them for the North I shall now on the contrary try to increase
 them on the South. I mean as to your going to Mount Morris. I saw
 a Sussex gentleman yesterday, who tells me they are frequently
 alarmed by Privateers on their coast, and what should hinder a few
 desperadoes from landing in the night and doing as they pleased on
 the coast.... I own it would give me a vast satisfaction to see you
 and Miss Robinson in Dover Street again.”

    [390] Field-Marshal George Wade, died 1748, ætat 75.

On October 1 Mr. Montagu writes from Allerthorpe--

  “MY DEAREST LOVE,

 “Since my last to you, we have heard nothing of the advancing of
 the Rebels, who, we have advice, are not above 5000, and most of
 them very shabby fellows. A Spy has been taken at Newcastle, said
 to belong to the Duke of Perth,[391] on whom was found a letter
 concealed in his glove. The contents are not yet made publick, no
 more than those of the letters found also on another person at
 the same place. The former has cut his throat, but is not dead.
 We are very quiet in these parts. The Captains are raising their
 men, and General Oglethorpe is getting together a flying Squadron
 of Volunteers, amongst whom are Mr. Tanfield of Calthorpe, and Dr.
 Chambers of Ripon. Captain Twycross is Lieutenant to Sir Reginald.

 “I hear the Dukes of Bedford and Devonshire and others are set out
 for their respective counties to raise men to assist in suppressing
 this rebellion.”

    [391] 3rd titular Duke of Perth, born 1720, died 1746.

He ends by entreating her to go at once to Horton, as Mount Morris was
more generally called in the family, and that till the country was
safe, she would not blame his staying north as long as he could be of
any service.

[Page heading: TUNBRIDGE WARE]

This letter hastened Mrs. Montagu’s and Sarah’s departure from
Tunbridge Wells. Writing to the Duchess of Portland on the eve of
starting, she asks her if she has

 “received a fan with Dr. Young’s picture in his riding
 accoutrements. I have taken the liberty to send you some Tunbridge
 ware, which in your magnificence you will despise, but I desire it
 may be sent to your Dairy, and there humbler thoughts will possess
 you, and churns of butter, prints, and skimming dishes will appear
 of consequence. I have sent you baskets for your goodyship to put
 your eggs in, also for feeding your poultry.”

[Page heading: SIR JOHN COPE]

On October 5 George Lewis Scott wrote to Mrs. Montagu, then at Mount
Morris, a long letter, a portion of which I copy. His handwriting,
though small, was clear and exceedingly elegant. He chaffs her and Miss
Robinson at taking refuge near the sea, and says, “If I were Captain
of a Privateer, and had 50 stout fellows to second me, I would carry
you and your whole family off in spite of the unconquered county of
Kent.”... After this he suggests

 “a vidette, a Sentinel on Horseback at a proper distance from
 the house, who may gallop home and give you timely allarm, your
 horses should be ready saddled.... The Army under Marshal Wade
 is not to rendezvous at Worcester till the 12th instant. If the
 Highlanders have begun their march as it is supposed, and that
 their Chiefs get their men to cross the borders, (no easy task,
 because of the prevailing tradition among them that none ever get
 back again), they may be in Yorkshire as soon as our Army. I am
 sorry that county is not better prepared, but alas! it is not easy
 to be prepared in a country rendered so artificially unwarlike as
 England. What signify all the speeches of the Orators, or rather of
 our ignorant, perhaps knavish babblers in Parliament against the
 Army? What has been the consequence of their insisting so often,
 contrary to common experience and common sense, that our Navy was
 a sufficient security. They only misled honest gentlemen. Their
 frothy words will not restore tranquillity, and public credit, nor
 repel the Highlanders. The Roman orators were also warriors, even
 Cicero was, I believe, a better General than most of ours, who have
 not forgot the Art of War, as Miss Robinson suggests: they never
 _learnt_ it.

 “_À propos_ of Generals, the following lines were made and repeated
 by a lady while asleep; her husband set them down, and astonished
 her with them in the morning; she remembered nothing of the
 matter:--

    “‘Say what reward shall be decreed
    For deeds like those of Sir John Cope?
    Reason and rhyme have both agreed
    His ribbon should be made a rope.’

 “You say, Madam, you have wasted, not spent your time at Tunbridge.
 Your health restored, and your reflections show me the contrary....”

Mr. Montagu now proposed returning from the North, thinking matters
were on a better footing, and intended fetching his wife from Mount
Morris, but Parliament being summoned, was forced to remain in Dover
Street. Mrs. Montagu proposed joining him from Kent on October 27.
In a letter to him on the 25th, she states, “The smugglers here are
all patriots it seems, which is very fortunate, for they assemble in
formidable numbers.”

Mrs. Robinson being threatened with a renewal of cancer in her breast,
was persuaded to accompany Mrs. Montagu to London for advice. In a
letter to the Duchess of Portland at this period Mrs. Montagu states--

 “The learned faculty have given us better hopes of my Mother’s
 case than I could have expected. They say it is not yet cancerous,
 and that it may be many years before it hurts her. Your Grace was
 excessively good in sending me the receipts which I have sent her,
 and also the Walnut medicine.”

The “Walnut medicine,” from; a letter of the duchess, appears to have
been made of the lining of the nuts.

[Page heading: MR. SCOTT’S APPETITE]

In a letter to Sarah of November 8 Mrs. Montagu jokes about Mr. Scott
being in love with Sarah, but his appetite being little diminished
by it, as he had just eaten most of a chine of mutton and two large
apple dumplings. He seems from other letters to have possessed a large
appetite! She then adds--

 “I think it is time to tell you all the news I have heard about
 the Rebels, God knows it is not very good: 5000 Irish Brigadiers
 from Dunkirk are embarked in order to land in Scotland to
 assist the Rebels. Ligonier[392] is sent for, Marshal Wade,
 who thinks he has forces enow, and the Dukes of Bedford,[393]
 Richmond,[394] Rutland,[395] and some others march in person to
 him immediately.... The Pretender is at Kelso on the borders of
 England. The Dutch troops are not to be depended upon, and ours are
 very drunken and licentious. The Parliament has not done anything
 remarkable for some days. On Thursday they had the Pretender’s
 declarations read, and after a Conference with the Lords ordered
 the Declaration to be burnt by the hands of the common Hangman.”

    [392] John, Earl of Ligonier, born 1678, died 1770. Field-Marshal,
    distinguished in Marlborough’s campaigns.

    [393] 4th Duke, born 1710, died 1771.

    [394] 7th Duke, born 1701, died 1750.

    [395] 3rd Duke, born 1696, died 1779.

[Page heading: MR. STANLEY’S LETTER]

[Page heading: TO THE DUKE OF MONTAGU]

Amongst Mr. Montagu’s papers endorsed by him “a letter of Mr. Stanley’s
to the Duke of M,” meaning John,[396] 2nd Duke of Montagu, his
relation, is the following:--

  “Boughton,[397] November 17, 1745.

  “MY LORD,

 “I received your Grace’s commands by express yesterday morning by
 six o’clock. I immediately wrote a letter to old Mr. Squire and his
 son, and expected an answer last night, but to my surprise John
 Goodwin came in without one, they being both in Huntingdonshire,
 and I expect every minute an answer which was promised by Mr.
 Squire. Mr. George Robinson I waited upon, and he expressed great
 satisfaction at your Grace’s kind favour of being made Captain
 Lieutenant in your Grace’s own troop of Horse, and returns your
 Grace his most dutiful thanks for the same. Your Grace is pleased
 to mention that the new rais’d Regiment will soon march northwards,
 at which both regiments have expressed much uneasiness: the men
 say they had no need to leave their houses and families to go
 for soldiery, that they and their forefathers have lived quietly
 and happily under your Grace and your forefathers as tenants for
 hundreds of years, that they would never have engaged to the Wars
 with anybody but your Grace, when they listed it was only to go
 along with your Grace to fight for you, and that they would go with
 nobody else. The Northamptonshire men are in the same story, they
 say if they had wanted to quit their professions to be soldiers
 they might have had five pounds a man to list in the Guards, or
 four pounds a man to list in a marching regiment, but they chose
 to list with your Grace for nothing, out of regard for you, and
 to go with you and fight for you, and nobody else. I believe one
 reason which made the people more uneasy is, that at the time they
 were raising, it was maliciously insinuated amongst them that
 your Grace’s name was only made use of to get them to list, and
 that they would be draughted and turned over to other Colonels,
 which made many backward in listing, and many of them are still
 apprehensive of being serv’d so, and declare if they are, they will
 sooner venture being shot for deserters than serve, and it has
 cost us much pains and many good words and a great deal of coaxing
 to bring them into temper; and we have told them that in fighting
 in defence of their King and country, wherever your Grace shall
 order them is the true way of serving your Grace, and that they
 may be assured they will not be draughted and turned over to other
 Colonels, and they seem now to be pretty easy for the present, and
 I believe, will march chearfully and willingly enough, when and
 wherever your Grace shall please to order them. Give me leave, my
 dear Lord Duke, once more to offer myself and fifty men, quite
 volunteers, to bear our own expenses, to wait on your Grace, if
 you must expose your person to danger, wherever you shall please
 to command us, and cloath ourselves in what manner you like best,
 and shall think ourselves happy in hazarding our lives for the
 preservation of yours, who are so dear a Father to your Country.

 “It being half an hour after 11 o’clock, I dare not stay any longer
 for Mr. Squire’s answer. I dare venture to say young Mr. Squire
 would be very glad to accept the Favour of your Grace’s convey of
 Horse. I have heard him say to that effect. I take the freedom to
 inclose a letter or two in this packet, and am,

  “My Lord,
  “Your Grace’s most humble,
  and Dutiful Servant to command,
  “D. STANLEY.”

The Duke of Montagu[398] raised three regiments, two of foot and one of

Earl of Sandwich.

    [398] The duke was Master of the Wardrobe, and Grandmaster of the
    Order of the Bath.

[Page heading: SIR FRANCIS DASHWOOD]

A letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess of Portland, dated November
19, says--

[Page heading: CATTLE MURRAIN]

 “Carlisle is surrendered to the rebels, who, I hear, behave
 civilly, and not as conquerors.... Ligonier is still ill; the Dukes
 of Richmond and Bedford are set out. Lord Sandwich is aide-de-camp
 to the Duke of Richmond. I pity poor Lady Sandwich, she endeavours
 to bear up, but certainly she is in an uneasy situation; I saw her
 on Sunday, and she is to dine here to-morrow.... I suppose you know
 Sir Francis Dashwood is upon the brink of matrimony. I see him
 sometimes with his intended bride, Lady Ellis; he is really very
 good company.”

This was the celebrated Sir Francis Dashwood,[399] afterwards Lord
Le Despencer, the leader of the infamous Hell Fire Club of the sham
Franciscan monks at Medmenham Abbey. Mention is made in this letter
of the murrain amongst the cattle, which raged to such a degree that
people forbore to eat beef or veal, or drink milk. A passage in a
letter of November 26 to the Rev. W. Freind, who was then at Bath,
reads--

 “The Duke of Cumberland set out yesterday, as did the Duke of
 Bedford and Lord Sandwich: the Duke of Montagu gave his Lordship
 one of his regiments. Almost all of our nobility are gone to the
 Army, so that many of the great families are in tears. Let it be
 said for the honour of our sex, there are no drums, no operas, and
 plays are unfrequented.”

    [399] He married Lady Ellis, December 19, 1745.

Sarah Robinson, writing from Mount Morris, states that they were in
great fear of an invasion of the French. It filled her with unspeakable
terror, as well as the servants; but she says--

 “My Father, you are to understand, is not at all concerned, he is
 not at all afraid of an invasion, nor don’t think there is the
 least probability of it, but for all that he has ordered everything
 to be packed up that can be packed.” She adds, “I don’t know that
 the French will invade us, but I am sure crossness has, and my
 Father is just miserably out of sorts, so it’s a pity but he should
 stay in the house, he would presently scold the French away.”

[Page heading: INVASION EXPECTED]

[Page heading: THE LAW REGIMENT]

The Montagus had now left London for Sandleford, and Mr. George L.
Scott writes the following letter to Mr. Montagu:--

  “London, December 12, 1745.

  “DEAR SIR,

 “I did not expect so sudden an occasion of writing to you. You need
 not, however, expect very important news, it being only to inform
 you that henceforward you may shine in the dignity of F.R.S., you
 were elected this evening, and may be admitted when you return to
 town. We had a very hot alarm this morning, of a descent of the
 French in Sussex. It was grounded upon a letter of a gentleman of
 distinction in your county; the Secretary of the Customs roused Mr.
 Pelham with the news at three, but a more certain and contradictory
 account came by eight, with us the report subsisted till two, and
 then vanished. Thus far, they say, may be depended on, that Dunkirk
 Harbour is filled with Ships. If the French can get a footing in
 Kent, it will be their fault if they do not do us inconceivable
 damages by destroying our docks, and raising heavy contributions.
 Were it not for some individuals, and innocent persons who would
 suffer on such an occasion, I should not grieve in the least to
 see some others pay the penalty of their infatuation or dastardly
 spirit. I only wish the King’s forces might be strong enough to
 take the booty from the French, and divide it among themselves;
 this would be no loss to the nation, and only transfer property
 from the fools or cowards to the brave. I say the same of the
 Northern counties, through which the Rebels have passed. They have
 behaved infamously. Sullivan, who was in Corsica with Marshal
 Maillebois,[400] has now felt the difference between modern
 Englishmen and Corsicans, much to the honour of the latter. These
 poor people, undisciplined and unarmed, almost with any thing but
 the spirit of liberty, baffled two veteran armies. Here a country
 more extensive than Corsica, better peopled, richer, and either
 well armed, or such as might have been so if they pleased, and
 with-all well furnished with plenty of horses, has tamely suffered
 itself to be overrun by a pack of foot banditti, two-thirds of
 which, by the best accounts, are scarce men, _pudet hæc opprobria_!

 “Our accounts from Scotland are but melancholy. The Rebels lay what
 contributions they please. Some Clans, they say, have taken arms,
 not with any intention to assist either side, but only to plunder.
 It is now at last agreed upon to bring over the Hessians. What a
 shame that we should want them! and what a shame that since any man
 might see we did want them, they were not brought over sooner. I
 say the same of the remainder of our country. Our administration
 puts me in mind of the rustic mentioned by Demosthenes, who coming
 into a fencing school, never foresaw a blow, but as soon as he was
 pushed, he would then clap his hand to the place, and so shift it
 after another blow, being thus always too late.

 “Our law regiment received his Majesty’s thanks much about the
 time you left this on Tuesday, with an intimation that the rebels
 being retired, he was unwilling to put us to any further trouble or
 expense. The frustrating this scheme is placed to the account of
 the mean jealousy of a certain great man. His family, I hear, on
 the other hand complain that he should be reproached on this head,
 when he was totally ignorant of the whole affair, and his being
 at all mentioned in it, was entirely owing to the indiscretion
 and impertinent zeal of some silly young fellows, who might fancy
 to obtain his favour by their conduct on this occasion, but what
 he totally disapproves of. What the truth of the matter is I know
 not, but I have my own suspicions, which possibly I may find an
 opportunity to verify. If they prove true, all I can say is I would
 not have some men’s souls for their estates.

 “My best respects to Mrs. Montagu. I hope she finds the country
 answer her expectations, as to health and every other respect.

  “I am, dear Sir,
  “Your most obedient, humble servant,
  “GEO. L. SCOTT.

 “10 o’clock--

 “The rebels set out from Manchester Northward, Tuesday last. They
 have murdered and plundered many. The Duke is in pursuit.

 “The Provost of Edʳ is to be sent to the Tower.”

    [400] Jean Des Marets Maillebois, born 1682, died 1762. French
    Marshal, conquered Corsica in 1739.

[Page heading: COUNT ST. GERMAIN]

In a letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess of Portland at this
period, she says--

 “Count St. Germain[401] was seized some days ago; it is said he
 had many jewels to a great value, and letters were found directing
 him how to manage the Papists in case the Pretender should
 approach and in what manner they were to use it. Sir R. Brown[402]
 offered to bail St. Germain. A transport Ship that was bringing
 officers over to the Rebels is taken. The old Pretender had sent
 his abdication of his crown, and orders to Charles to publish the
 manifestoes in his own name. The Lawyers offered to form themselves
 into a regiment to guard the Royal family, but Lord Chief Justice
 Willes’[403] friends insisted on his being Colonel, which has
 discouraged the affair.”

    [401] Comte De Saint Germain, born 1707, died 1778. French General.

    [402] Probably Lieut.-General George Brown.

    [403] John Willes, born 1685, died 1761.

[Page heading: ROMNEY MARSH]

Meanwhile the fears of a French invasion increased in the southern
counties, as will be seen by this letter of Mrs. Robinson’s to Mrs.
Montagu--

  “December 15, 1745.

  “MY DEAR,

 “Before you receive this you will have heard from Sally that she
 this day sett forward for Cantʸ, in order to proceed for London
 to-morrow morning: indeed the frequent alarms we have had for this
 last week has been too much for her spirits, and I pressed her
 to go, for she was not able to make herself easy in staying, and
 yet, poor girl, she went with great heaviness, though she had a
 mind to it, and Mr. Robinson, though he thought the fright more
 than necessary, was very easy with it. Yesterday he had a certain
 account from Dover that Admiral Vernon sent yᵐ an express last
 Tuesday, yt he had reason to believe yt ye French design’d landing
 a great force (it was said 200,000, though yt, I think, must be
 a mistake) at Dover, or on the Kentish coast, and ordered them to
 keep themselves in readiness to oppose them: 400 men keep watch
 at nights, and ye inhabitants keep all their best effects packed
 up to send away at ye first approach of danger. These things much
 magnified, and told in many different shapes, are sufficient to
 alarm most people that live where we do, for should any army land
 on ye coast of Kent, I am told Romney[404] is the most convenient
 place, as there is a fine flat to land on, and no opposition can
 be made, as we are destitute of forces, and the people entirely
 unarmed and frightened out of their wits: we are in the worst
 situation of any gentleman’s house in the county in such a case,
 for they must pass within two or three fields[405] of ye house,
 if not through the yard, and you know we stand very visible, yt
 in such case, which God forbid, we must be great sufferers, they
 wou’d certainly spoil what they cou’d not carry away, and probably
 set fire to the house. But as to our selves, I don’t doubt but we
 are as safe as the rest of the Nation, for we have given orders
 for an express to come away if any landing appears in ye Marsh,
 and should set out in an hour’s time, whereas an army would be
 some days in landing. Nor am I in any fright, no do I believe they
 dare attempt any such thing, but that ye transports that lay manᵉᵈ
 at Dunkirk are designed to land some forces in Scotland, of wcʰ
 two was taken, and broᵗ into Deal yesterday, bound for Montrose,
 and I think Suffolk would be a better place yⁿ ye Kentish coast,
 and less guarded: but I will tell you what I have done by way of
 precaution. I have packed up all ye lining, plate and Clothes yt
 cou’d be spared from constant use, and all writings, and they are
 ready loaded in the waggon, and secured tennants’ horses to carry
 them off. As to furniture, it may take its fate, as I cou’d neither
 put it up properly, nor get carriages to carry it off on ye sudden,
 and it wou’d be great expence, and great damage to do it to no
 purpose. Pray don’t be in any fright for us, for you may be sure we
 shall take care of ourselves so far as not to be caught, and that
 is all anybody can do. I shall be greatly concern’d shou’d such a
 thing happen, for our own misfortune and those of everybody’s else,
 for ye whole nation must be sufferers, though some may feel it in a
 more particular manner than others, as they wou’d be more in ye way
 of these people. I am much at ease yt Sally is gone, as a sudden
 alarm might have affected her so as to have highten’d my fright,
 wʰ wou’d have been more for her than for myself. There is orders
 come to ye Deputy Lieutenants to raise ye Militia, we hear yt the
 Dutch Ships with Admiral Vernon sail’d this afternoon northwards,
 by which we hope ye fears of this part grow less, or he wou’d not
 lessen his forces.

 “I think the wind will never be fair for poor Robert.[406] Sure
 they are not still off Galway....

 “Mr. Robinson joins with me in our best compliments to Mr. Montagu,
 and love to yourself,

  “I am, my dear,
  “Yours most affectionately,

    Indies.

Sarah Robinson had taken refuge with her friend, Mrs. Cotes, in Charles
Street. In a letter to the duchess of December 16, Mrs. Montagu says,
“I hear the Rebels made great havoc at Levens, which has greatly
established the Countess’ loyalty to the Hanover succession.”

[Page heading: LEVENS HALL]

Levens Hall, in Westmorland, was the beautiful seat of the 4th Earl of
Berkshire, brought him by his wife, Catherine Grahame. They were the
parents of William Lord Andover, whose wife was the intimate friend of
Mrs. Botham.

[Page heading: A FOOTMAN]

A passage in a letter to the Rev. William Freind concerning a footman
indicates the manners and wages of that time. Mrs. Montagu says--

 “Pray is the young man who you once proposed to me for a servant
 at liberty now? For my footman thinks my wages not equal to his
 parts and merits. The servant I part with, is very honest, but I
 cannot bring him to deliver his sincerity in such delicate terms
 as are necessary in a message. He told a lady of quality who
 inquired after my health, that I was _pure stout_, and if I am in
 good spirits he tells people I am _brave_, that he is likely to
 establish me as a character of violence.... If your youth can carry
 a message, keep himself sober and clean, and stay at home, when he
 is not sent abroad, they are all the qualifications I desire. He
 is to have livery, and frock every year, and six pounds wages the
 first year, the second seven. He is to put out his washing.”

Greater threatenings than ever of an invasion arose at the end of
December. Mr. and Mrs. Montagu implored her parents to take refuge in
their house in Dover Street. Mrs. Robinson, on December 25, says--

  “MY DEAR,

 “I return you and Mr. Montagu my sincere thanks for the kind offer
 of your house, and should I be obliged to run away of the sudden, I
 shall certainly make use of it till I can get lodgings.

 “Last night a drunken fellow went through Hanford, and told yᵐ yt
 ye French was landing in the Marsh, wh. was presently believed,
 and 500 men was ready to march from thence this morning, when they
 found it to be a lie. It is a pitty ye country is quite without
 arms, for the people show great alacrity to defend themselves. Your
 Father has gone to dine with Mr. Brockman,[407] and as he is not
 returned, the coast was certainly clear when he went over the hill.”

    [407] At Beachborough.

[Page heading: A BRAVE GAMEKEEPER!]

Mr. Robinson had armed a number of his tenants, and appointed John
Cullen, the gamekeeper, as Master of the Ordnance. This amused Mrs.
Montagu, as in a letter to Mrs. Robinson she says--

 “I fancy John has little notion of a gun without a dog, and though
 a mighty hunter, his prey not being man, he would probably run
 away, or take to covert. I once saw my Father arm our Militia to
 take up Jarvis, the Highwayman, and I own I thought the warrant the
 only arms they durst use against the offender.”

In the same letter she comments on the prevailing expectation that the
Pretender would arrive at some particular place. “They expected the
Pretender at Newbury three weeks ago. I had a mind to have asked them
if he loved eels, for really I don’t know any other seduction he would
have to have called on them....”

Lady Oxford wrote one morning to the Duchess of Portland that “it was
said the Rebels would be at Welbeck by one o’clock, but did not leave
her house, which I think was very wrong, but she is always composed.”

This is the last letter of 1745.




CHAPTER VII.

1746–1748--CHIEFLY IN LONDON AND BATH AND AT SANDLEFORD--VISITS TO
BULLSTRODE AND TO CAMBRIDGE.


[Year: 1746]

The first letter of 1746 is dated January 1 to the Duchess of Portland
at Bullstrode.

The Montagus remained quietly at Sandleford till Parliament met.

[Page heading: THE DEATH OF MRS. ROBINSON]

At the end of April, or commencement of May, Mrs. Montagu lost her
excellent and amiable mother from a return of her former illness. I
have no letters till the following one, undated, in reply for a letter
of condolence of Mrs. Freind’s:--

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “The tender hand of a friend does all in the power of human art
 to heal the wounds given by affliction. That you love me, and
 interest yourself for me, must on all occasions give me comfort.
 It is not consistent with duty or prudence to be ever considering
 one’s loss with those circumstances of tenderness that make one
 unable to bear up against it, so I will say as little as possible
 of the dear, tender parent, and endeavour to recollect her only as
 a most excellent woman, and try to become good by her example. She
 concluded with an heroic constancy the most virtuous life. From
 her prosperity she drew arguments of resignation and patience, and
 expressed the greatest thankfulness that Providence had lent her
 so many blessings without repining that they were to be taken
 away. How few are they that do not grow proud and stubborn by
 that indulgence which made her humble and resigned! She had spent
 her life in doing those just, right things that bring peace at
 the last; and after living so many years in the world, left it
 with the greatest innocence of soul and integrity of heart I ever
 knew. How much superior is this to the forced and immeritorious
 innocence of a sequestered Cloister; for after having bent to all
 the duties of human life, she had not contracted any of the vices
 or bad affections of it; nor had she the least tincture of the
 secret faults of malice or envy which often lurk about the hearts
 of those who are esteemed persons of unblameable conduct. Through
 every action of her life she deserved to be loved and esteemed, and
 in her death almost to be adored, for in that scene she appeared
 almost more than human. But this subject is too affecting, nor
 can I think of my final separation from such a friend with the
 resignation I ought.

 “I beg you would think favourably of a journey to Sandleford: you
 cannot imagine the pleasure it would give me to see you there. We
 are still roasting in this dusty town, but hope a very few days
 will carry us into the country.

  “I am, dear Mrs. Freind’s
  “Most affectionate cousin,
  and sincere friend,
  “ELIZ. MONTAGU.”

[Page heading: LYDIA BOTHAM]

The only other letter on this subject is from Mrs. Lydia Botham, Mrs.
Laurence Sterne’s sister, a portion of which I give. The handwritings
of the two sisters[408] were much alike--

  “Yoxall, May 25, 1746.

  “MY DEAR COUSIN,

 “If your knowing how sensible I am of your loss of my dear Aunt,
 and how deeply I share in your affliction, could afford you any
 relief, I should endeavour to lay open a most sorrowful Heart to
 you, tho’ I could send you but a faint copy of it, for my grief,
 like yours, is at present too big for utterance. I can offer
 nothing for your consolation, but what I’m sure your own thoughts
 will have suggested to you; that the Dear, the Valuable Parent you
 have lost has lived to enjoy the Greatest Blessing a parent can
 have, the seeing her children brought up in health and prosperity;
 that she who acted so strictly up to her duty in every capacity
 here is only removed from the Happiness she reap’d in her Family,
 to receive the further and infinitely greater Reward of her
 well-doing; that since the Giver of Life saw fit to finish hers by
 so painful a Distemper, it is some comfort that her Misery was of
 no longer duration.

 “From these considerations I am persuaded you will find all the
 consolation that such an affliction can admit of. Your letter is
 dated the 5th, but it did not reach me till the last post, and had
 the Dublin postmark on it. I had received the melancholy news from
 Lady Suffolk, but could not write to you immediately upon your
 misfortune. The news of my poor Aunt’s Death is a heavy addition
 to such a load of sorrow as I was before nearly ready to sink
 under. My eldest girl has lately discovered some tendency to my
 asthmatical Disorder; the Thought that she received this from me,
 and that the rest of my dear Babes stand the same unhappy chance,
 is such an affliction to me....

 “I mourn with my Uncle, but shall forbear writing to him for fear
 of adding to his concern.”

    [408] Mr. Botham was Vicar of Yoxall, Staffordshire.

By the will of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Morris, the estates of
Mount Morris and East Horton, Kent, now passed to Matthew Robinson,
Mrs. Montagu’s eldest brother. His father, Mr. Robinson, who had always
disliked country life, now made London his headquarters. In a letter of
June 22, to the Duchess of Portland, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “We shall stay in London about a week getting a plan for finishing
 a house which we are to have in a street near Berkeley Square, in a
 street not yet much built; it will be better to stay a year for the
 finishing than to take what one does not like.”

This was the house in Hill Street, in which she lived many years.

[Page heading: ALBURY]

At this period Lord Andover presented the Rev. John Botham to the
living of Albury in Surrey. Mrs. Botham and Mrs. Sterne had, as we
learn from a letter of Mrs. Montagu’s, been brought up in great luxury,
with a constant succession of company, whilst their father, the Rev.
Robert Lumley, was alive. Reduced to poverty by his death, they both
married men of small fortune, therefore one is not surprised that Lydia
Botham, unaccustomed to small means, and, in spite of her delicacy,
extremely fond of society, soon incurred debt and embarrassment with a
growing family and small income.

Lady Andover, who was her constant and best friend, writes on June 26
to Mrs. Montagu to explain the excessive melancholy of Lydia, who was
proceeding that week to Albury. She says--

 “The blame they lay upon themselves for having lived beyond their
 circumstances and the sense of having injured their children, of
 whom they are most tender, is a reflection sufficient to bring a
 person of Lydia’s sense and goodness to the dejected state she is
 in. I that love and value her most sincerely, and _who have largely
 shared in the best she was ever possest of_, bear a great share in
 her sufferings....”

[Page heading: A “JOHNNY!”]

She then goes on to talk of how she and the Duchess of Portland wished
to get more preferment for Mr. Botham.

 “I have not seen Harry Legge[409] for a great while, but I know
 he has a very sincere regard for Lydia, and should hope it was in
 his power to do them some good, but then Alas! poor Johnny is such
 a Johnny that there arises all the difficulty of getting them any
 preferment. Lydia also is so blind to all his defects that the
 least disrespectful thought of Johnny would make her more than ever
 miserable.” She continues to say, “Any exchange from Staffordshire
 must be advantageous to them, for there, as they unfortunately
 began with entering into all the expenses that attend a great
 neighbourhood, they could never have lived in the way they intend
 doing and may do here.... This place is but a mile from them, and I
 don’t despair of making a very beaten path between us by constant
 use.”

    [409] Harry Legge, second son of the Earl of Dartmouth, was Lord of
    the Treasury and Chancellor of Exchequer; a first cousin of Lady
    Andover’s.

Mrs. Montagu hastened to Albury, and, from a letter of Lady Andover’s,
appears to have not only given good advice for the future, but
helped their purse. Harry Legge also paid them a visit, endeavoured
to persuade them they could live on £300 a year, gave good advice,
but made no promise for the future. Lady Andover says, “He gave them
frugal good advice, but no hints or promises to make the discourse be
relished; he went away yesterday morning, and I am persuaded when it is
in his power he will remember them.” At the end of the letter she says--

 “I am quite of your mind concerning Lord Tullibardine,[410] full of
 wonder that he should chuze to sneak out of life much more like a
 rebell than resolutely suffering publick execution. I hear of great
 interest making for tickets to see the executions,[411] and fear
 humanity is at a very low ebb.”

    [410] William Murray, Marquis of Tullibardine; died July 9, 1746.

    [411] The Earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino.

[Page heading: THE “LITTLE PÈRE”]

Mrs. Montagu was much distressed by the poor boy employed in her garden
at Sandleford having accidentally fallen into a pond there and been
drowned, an account of which she writes to the duchess on August 7.
In this letter she begs the duchess to send the “Little Père,” as he
was fondly called (Dr. Courayer), to stay with her, from Bullstrode,
where he had been domiciled some time. At the same time she asks for
two peacocks, “After asking for Dr. Courayer to beg your two peacocks,
are there in Nature things that differ like this Philosopher and the
bird of noise, vanity, and ostentation?” The peacocks were to console a
white pea-hen at Sandleford for the loss of her mate, a white peacock,
which, together with a quantity of poultry, had been stolen by the
bargemen of Newbury. The Montagus sent a party of armed servants to
inspect the barges, but only feathers and eggs were discovered. The
peacocks were duly conveyed by waggon to the “Windmill,” Slough, whence
the Newbury waggoner, Sandy, conveyed them to Sandleford. The duchess,
in writing about them, adds, “Lord Cromartie is pardoned; the King sent
for my Lady to acquaint him with it. Was not that doing it in the most
tender, compassionate manner?”

Mrs. Donnellan was at this time at Tunbridge, at Lord Percival’s house,
and Mrs. Montagu jokingly confided her father, Mr. Robinson, who was
there, to her care. On August 5 Mrs. Donnellan writes to say of Mr.
Robinson, “I can assure you he is in very good widower’s spirits.” She
adds, “He has lent me his chariot daily to carry me home at night to
Lord Percival’s.” Mrs. Donnellan waited at Tunbridge till the death of
her friend, Sir Robert Sutton,[412] which was daily expected; when it
took place she accompanied his widow, Lady Sunderland,[413] and his
daughter, Miss Sutton, to London.

    [412] The Right Hon. Sir Robert Sutton, of Broughton, Lincolnshire.

    [413] Wife of Sir Robert Sutton; had been third wife to 4th Earl of
    Sunderland.

[Page heading: DEATH OF MR. CARTER]

Mrs. Botham, having an alarming attack of asthma which caused her six
sleepless nights, Mrs. Montagu writes to recommend her Valerian tea,
made from the roots. Evidently “Lydia” was not a notable housekeeper,
as she also instructs her in the art of keeping a weekly account book,
and entering in it every item of expense. The duchess was anxious for
the Montagus to go to Bullstrode, but the visit was deferred, as the
three younger Robinsons were spending their holidays at Sandleford, and
the captain and Morris Robinson expected Mr. and Mrs. Freind there as
well. Poor old Mr. Carter, the steward, was just dead of fever, which,
it was thought, he caught when on agent’s work at Newcastle, where
fever had been rife amongst the unhappy prisoners of the ’45 confined
there. He was a great loss to Mr. Montagu, who was contemplating a
journey north to place his affairs in young Mr. Edward Carter’s[414]
hands. Dr. Conyers Middleton, in a letter from Bath, of September
21, proposes setting out at Michaelmas “with young Frederick” for
Sandleford for a few days. Mr. Montagu, accompanied by Mr. Carter, had
set out on their northern journey, staying at Newbold Verdon with Mr.
James Montagu _en route_, arriving at Theakstone by October 7.

    [414] He was agent to Lord Aylesbury.

On October 12, from Theakstone, Mr. Montagu writes to his wife--

 “Mr. Carter has now dispatched what business he had to do for Lord
 Aylesbury at his courts, and is now at liberty, and on Tuesday
 morning we design to set out for New Castle. Eryholme we shall
 take in our way....

 “I have now with me Mr. Buckley and Mr. Emerson;[415] amidst all
 these avocations j have found time to study and profit by the
 Hurworth Philosopher as much as j proposed, and shall not when j
 return from Newcastle, have occasion to delay my journey for any
 further instruction from him. I am glad Dr. Middleton is going to
 publish, and the rather because you approve of what he has done.
 It is a fine subject,[416] and none is capable of doing it more
 justice than he can. I wonder the young Lord Hervey[417] should
 refuse to deliver up the Doctor’s letters, for it would have been a
 great loss to the learned world if he could not have retrieved the
 matter of them as he has done.”

    [415] William Emerson, eminent mathematician; author of “Doctrine
    of Fluxions,” etc.

    [416] An account of the Roman Senate. He allowed Mrs. Montagu to
    read the manuscript.

    [417] George William, Baron Hervey, 2nd Earl of Bristol.

[Page heading: DENTON]

On October 19, from Newcastle, Mr. Montagu writes--

  “MY DEAREST,

 “Yesterday Mr. Carter and j rid out and view’d Mr. Rogers’ estate
 of Denton lying upon the river west of this town, a fine tract
 of land with a fine colliery belonging to it. After we came in
 Bp. Benson of Gloucester, who had been doing duty for the Bishop
 of Durham, being at our inn, desir’d the Drawer to present his
 compliments, and would be glad to see me.... He is a very polite
 man.... This morning Mr. Bowes[418] came and made me a visit,
 invited me to Gibside, and proffered me any assistance he could
 give me. I promised to pay my respects to him and dine with him
 when j was prepar’d to talk with him about those affairs in
 which he and Mr. Rogers are concern’d in partnership.... Mr.
 Rogers’ affairs consist of a great many concerns, particularly
 in collieries, lying at a great distance from each other, and as
 they have been neglected, great encroachments have been made which
 require some pains to detect.”

    [418] Mr. George Bowes, owner of Gibside Park, Streatlam Castle,
    and Hilton Castle, Durham.

[Page heading: LADY PRIMROSE]

Early in November Mrs. Montagu visited London to take leave of her two
sailor brothers, who were going to China. On the 10th she was to visit
Bullstrode. In writing to the duchess on the 2nd she says--

 “I am very glad Lady Wallingford has not left Bullstrode, extreamly
 rejoiced Mrs. Delany is come there, infinitely happy Lady
 Primrose[419] remains there, and for Mr. Freind I propose much
 happiness in seeing him.”

    [419] _Née_ Anne Drelincourt, wife of 3rd Viscount Primrose. Lord
    Rosebery says she once sheltered the Pretender.

On November 24, writing to Mr. Montagu, his wife says--

 “I wish my brother Morris had done Lord Lovat’s[420] trial; I have
 great desire to see the Solicitor-General’s speech. As to Sir W.
 Young and Lord Cooke’s, I heard them perfect, and shall perhaps
 hardly think them worth further regard and attention. I lost a
 great deal of Secretary Murray’s speech, which, as it combined an
 account of the first overtures of the rebellion, I think matter of
 curiosity.”

    [420] He was beheaded April 9, 1747.

The curious remedies of the period are shown in a letter of Mrs.
Botham, of November 25, where she says she has been taking _Elixir of
Vitriol_ for her asthma, and is now going to try _Tar Water_, then
supposed to be a universal medicine. She adds that the Glebelands,
sixty acres in extent at Albury, had been let for £17 a year for thirty
years, but as no one bid “Johnny” more, he was now farming it himself,
as it provides our family with “grain, fowls, bacon, milk, butter and
eggs.”

In the next letter from Bullstrode, to Mr. Robinson, his daughter says--

 “Mrs. Delany tells me Mr. Granville thinks himself very happy in
 passing some of his hours with you. She says she has great ambition
 to please you as you are an artist and a connoisseur. She is now
 copying a portrait of Sacharissa from Vandyck, and I believe it
 will please you very well.... The Duchess is in better spirits
 than ever I knew her; time has added accomplishments to her young
 family, her gardens are much improved, her house is new furnished.”

[Page heading: DR. SHAW]

The last letter of the year to the duchess mentions--

 “I hear there is going to be published a new comedy by Dr.
 Hoadley[421] and a tragedy by Mr. Thomson. I have no great
 expectations of the comedy, for Dr. Hoadley is a sober physician,
 and must be a kind of comedian _malgré lui_. As to Mr.
 Thomson,[422] we know the pitch of his muse, and with what dignity
 his buskins tread the Stage.” She winds up with “best respects to
 the huge ‘Godfather of all Shell-fish,’ who, tho’ not so frisky I
 presume, as nimble as his Seabrother the Leviathan, or his Hornie
 palfrey the Seahorse, or his lapdog the Porpoise.”

    [421] Benjamin Hoadley, born 1706, died 1757. Physician to George
    II.; wrote “The Suspicious Husband.”

    [422] “Tancred and Sigismund.”

This alludes to Dr. Shaw, the traveller, a constant visitor at
Bullstrode, and a connoisseur in shells,[423] which the duchess took
great delight in collecting.

    [423] _Vide_ the Catalogue of the Portland Museum of 1786, in which
    are hundreds of rare shells.


[Year: 1747]

An undated letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess of Portland of 1747
in my collection, alluding to her visit at Bullstrode, is probably the
first of that year. She says--

 “I am this instant from the play, where I have been extremely
 entertained with that most comick of all personages, Sir John
 Falstaffe; as to Hotspur, he was in a very violent passion in the
 first act, and I think it is a part not equal to the genius of
 Garrick.”

Garrick and Quin were this season taking alternate parts. Quin was then
playing Falstaffe.

A letter of Mr. Robinson’s of April 25 describes him giving a Drum in
London, “4 card tables and others who did not play, and they were all
a Kentish Set.... Dr. and Mrs. Middleton are in town, but they talk of
going in a fortnight. I will tell you what I think of her when I see
you.” This was Dr. Conyers Middleton’s third wife, Anne Powell, whom he
had just married, but the exact date I am uncertain of.

[Page heading: YOUNG EDWARD WORTLEY MONTAGU]

Two curious letters to Mr. Montagu from his eccentric young cousin,
Edward Wortley Montagu, occur next. He was the only son of Mr.
Montagu’s first cousin, Edward Wortley Montagu, whose father, Sidney
Montagu, was the second son of the great Earl of Sandwich. Sidney
Montagu married Anne, daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Wortley, and
assumed the name of Wortley. By her he had one son, Edward Wortley
Montagu, who married Lady Mary Pierpoint, daughter of Evelyn, Duke of
Kingston; they had two children, Edward, born in 1713, and Mary, born
1718, who married John, Earl of Bute. To give young Wortley Montagu’s
eccentric life here would take too much space, but the reader will find
an epitome of it at the end of this work. In 1745, he was in the Army
through the influence of his relation, the Duke of Montagu, had been
through the campaign, and was present at the Battle of Fontenoy. He
became a prisoner of war, but was shortly before the date of the first
letter exchanged, and, coming to England, was given, by the Earl of
Chesterfield,[424] a commission to carry a packet of important papers
to his relation, Lord Sandwich,[425] being informed of the contents of
them in case he was waylaid and robbed. Mr. Montagu had always acted a
kind part towards his young cousin, and frequently interceded for him
with his father, old Wortley Montagu, in his endless escapades, which
were enough to try any parent’s heart.

    [424] Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, celebrated
    politician and author; then Secretary of State.

    [425] Then Minister Plenipotentiary to the States General.

[Page heading: ACTION IN HOLLAND]

As the letters are of interminable length, I only quote portions of
them. In the first, from Harwich, April 22, becalmed _en route_ for
the Army, he begs Mr. Edward Montagu to recommend him to the Duke
of Montagu as messenger to the Court of Prussia, whither he heard a
despatch was to be sent. He alludes to his father having visited Lord
Chesterfield to ask about him, as they were not on speaking terms
then, though his father was at the same time anxious he should enter
Parliament. The second letter is from Ter Goes, May 15, 1747 (N.S.)--

 “We sailed from Harwich with the wind contrary, and were two
 pacquets in company. We were attacked by a privateer of 16 guns
 and got clear of him after a combat of between four and five
 hours. As soon as I arrived at Helvoet, I went immediately to the
 Hague, staid one day there, and then went on to H.R.H.[426] with a
 pacquet from Lord Sandwich; the moment the Duke saw me he told me
 I was released, and ordered me to take post and join my regiment.
 The moment I got to the regiment, I found it retreating from the
 French, having lost between two and three hundred men and about 10
 officers killed or wounded; our Major is among the former. When
 we got to the seaside we did not find vessels enough to embark
 us all, so our regiment, as the eldest, embarked the last, but
 when all Braggs’ and most of the Highlanders were got off, we and
 the remainder of them were attacked by a body of 1200. They were
 so well received that they quitted us, after having lost three
 officers and about twenty-seven men. We lost only one officer and
 a very few men. Billanders came just then, and we got off very
 luckily, for had we staid ten minutes longer we should all have
 been killed or taken, for we were scarce on board when we saw a
 considerable body march to the ground we had been on....”

    [426] The Duke of Cumberland.

Edward Wortley Montagu’s handwriting was excessively neat; his
signature, with peculiar flourishes to the “Edward,” is unmistakable
when once known.

A dissolution and general election of Parliament took place in June,
and Mr. Montagu hastened to Huntingdon for re-election, leaving Mrs.
Montagu packing up and removing furniture, etc., from Dover Street to
their new house in Hill Street, which was being finished and decorated.

[Page heading: GENERAL ELECTION]

In a letter of June 18, from Huntingdon, Mr. Montagu says--

 “Yesterday was a day of more business, for we walked the town,
 where we met with very uncommon success, having met with one
 negative only. Mr. Wortley[427] the elder came from Peterborough to
 give us his assistance.... He seems very well pleased with what my
 Lord has done for his son,[428] and will, j dare say, bring about a
 perfect reconciliation, tho’ as yet they have not seen one another,
 nor will till they perhaps may both be in London.

 “The day for my election is not yet fixed.... I may, if time should
 allow, ride over to Cambridge to congratulate Dr. Middleton on his
 marriage.”

    [427] Old Wortley Montagu.

    [428] Edward Wortley Montagu.

[Page heading: HUNTINGDON ELECTION]

Lord Sandwich gave Mr. Montagu £500 towards his election expenses.
Young Wortley Montagu was trying for Parliament at the same time, and
was returned, and Matthew Robinson was seeking election for Canterbury.

On June 23 Mrs. Montagu writes her last letter from Dover Street
to her husband: “I am now on the point of leaving this town and my
disfurnished house.... Please to send to the Crown Inn for a box, in
which I have sent your frock with the gold loops. My brother does not
meet with any opposition.”

The Hill Street house being still unfinished, Mrs. Montagu went to
Sandleford, accompanied by Mrs. Donnellan, previously securing a room
for her husband in town, “my Father’s lodgings at Mrs. Cranwell’s in
Shepheard Street, near Red Lion Square.”

On June 30 Mr. Montagu writes--

 “My Dearest, it is with great pleasure that j can tell you our
 election is well over. Everything passed yesterday in the manner
 one could wish, and there was little of that riot and madness which
 is the constant concomitant of things of this nature. Captain John
 Montagu, who represented Mr. Courteney, is yet here on account of
 a ball which we are this night to have in the Assembly Rooms. My
 cousin[429] gives great satisfaction in the county. I think his
 nature to be good as well as his parts, and hope he will be an
 ornament to his family. I am sure he is very grateful to me. I have
 invited him to Sandleford.... My Lord Sandwich is entire master
 both of this town and county. He has so riveted his interest, that
 j believe nobody will venture to oppose as long as he lives. He is
 really a very great young man, with great talents, and many amiable
 qualities.”

    [429] Young Edward Wortley Montagu.

On July 8 Mr. Montagu writes from London, having changed his lodging
to “Mrs. Barrows at the Golden Fleece” in New Bond Street. He says--

 “I left Huntingdon on Fryday in the afternoon, and got to Cambridge
 between seven and eight in the evening, walked about the Colleges,
 and then sent for Mr. Branson to enquire about the Canterbury
 Election. The next morning at eight, j waited on Dr. Middleton and
 breakfasted and din’d with him and his wife. The Doctor receiv’d me
 in a very agreeable and friendly manner, ask’d me why j did not the
 night before take up my lodging with him, press’d my longer stay.
 He has married a very agreeable, good-natur’d woman, her person is
 extreamly good, in her prime, must have been very handsome. She
 seems to have very good sense and a great deal of good nature.
 She went along with the Doctor and j, and spent an hour or two
 seeing Dr. Woodward’s Fossils,[430] and afterwards she entertain’d
 us playing on the Harpsichord, in which she is a considerable
 proficient; in short, the Doctor seems to have consulted his
 happiness in what he has done, and j congratulated him upon it in
 the handsomest manner j could.”

    [430] John Woodward, born 1665, died 1728. Geologist; founded a
    chair of geology at Cambridge.

[Page heading: DR. POCOCKE]

Dr. Courayer had now joined the Sandleford party.

 “Dr. Pococke[431] and his family dined here yesterday. After dinner
 we all went to see the Vieux Hermite, who received us at the gate
 in a manner rather smiling Eastern courtesy and ceremony than rural
 simplicity; he bow’d to the ground several times, led me in, then
 accosted the little Père by the title of _the_ Courayer.... Standen
 asked Mary classical questions, of Dr. Pococke particularly whether
 he had been on the plains of Pharsalia and of Marathon, and if he
 had passed the Straits of Thermopylæ. He was overjoyed to hear the
 Temple of Theseus was entire. Dr. Pococke is a faithful relater of
 what he has seen, but does not embellish his narrations with any
 imagination of fancy.”

    [431] Rev. Dr. Pococke, born 1704, died 1765. Bishop of Ossory and
    Meath; author of “Descriptions of the East,” etc.

[Page heading: WEST WOODHAY]

Writing to the duchess on July 6, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “A few days ago I carried Mrs. Donnellan and the little Père to see
 Mr. Sloper’s gardens[432] and house at a time when I was assured
 he was absent on his election, but seeing a man ride up the avenue
 at the same time, I took it into my head it might be Mr. Sloper,
 so I did not alight immediately. The housekeeper came to me and
 asked if I would walk in; I said I should be glad to see the house
 if Mr. Cibber was not at home; the housekeeper looked aghast, as
 if she had spoilt a custard or broke a jelly glass; I coloured,
 Mrs. Donnellan tittered, Dr. Courayer sputtered, half French, half
 English, and began to search for the case of a spying glass I had
 dropt in my fright. As my organs of speech rather than of sight,
 seemed defective, I was little interested for my perspective, but
 sat in the coach making melancholy reflections on my mistake. Mrs.
 Donnellan could not compose her countenance, so that we were near
 a quarter of an hour before we got out of the coach; and after so
 long a pause I walked into the house, greatly abashed.”

    [432] Mr. Sloper lived at West Woodhay House, near Newbury, built
    by Inigo Jones.

To understand this joke it must be explained that Mrs. Theophilus
Cibber,[433] the celebrated actress, was the mistress of Mr. Sloper.
She had been forced into marriage with Theophilus Cibber,[434] son
of “old Cibber,” the celebrated actor, and her husband, who was a
worthless man, had connived at the connection. In a previous letter
of Mrs. Montagu’s, of 1744, mention is made of a house at West Woodhay
furnished by Mr. Sloper for Mrs. Cibber “entirely in white satin.” A
further passage says--

[Page heading: DR. COURAYER]

 “I believe I could shake your spleen with a description of Dr.
 Courayer’s figure--when he arrived here from Oxford through a
 whole day’s rain; but let it suffice that he shone with drops of
 water like the Diamond ficoides. How his beaver was slouched,
 his coloured handkerchief twisted, and his small boots stuck to
 his small legs; how the rain had uncurled his wig, the spleen
 dejected his countenance, the cramp spoiled his gait! not being
 much accustomed to riding he was so fatigued and benumbed he could
 scarce walk, that for so good a Christian he appeared surprizingly
 like Un Diable boiteux. Mrs. Donnellan and I could not help
 laughing; with the vivacity of his nation, he fell in with the
 mirth and helped on the raillery his figure provoked.”

Mr. Montagu was detained in London by much legal business. He tells his
wife her father, Mr. Robinson, carries him to Ranelagh. She retorts, “I
am very glad my Father carries you to Ranelagh, but tell him I desire
he would not make you a coquette, a character I think him a little
inclined for.”

    [433] Anna Maria Cibber, _née_ Arne, celebrated actress, born 1714,
    died 1766.

    [434] Theophilus Cibber, son of Colley Cibber, actor and dramatist,
    died 1757.

On July 18 mention is made of Lord Sandwich embarking for the seat of
war.

The next letter, July 23, to Mr. Montagu, from young Edward Wortley
Montagu, who had been returned Knight of the Shire of Huntingdon,
described an election ball. “Our ball last Monday was very brilliant.
We had a very elegant supper for near 200 people, and finished by
dancing till 6 in the morning.” He mentions “my friend untieing his
purse strings with the greatest reluctance, and was very peevish to
see so many people at Supper, which he thinks very unwholesome.” This
is probably old Wortley, his father. A christening of one of Lady
Sandwich’s children had just taken place. Mrs. Montagu was godmother
by proxy. “I assure you I wished the real Godmothers had been there
instead of the substitutes.” Then stating Lord Sandwich had left so
hastily they did not know if he had arranged for venison for the races,
he begs Mr. Montagu to ask the Duke of Montagu to send him two bucks,
“to be here by Tuesday.”

The Duchess of Portland, writing on July 24, mentions “Lady Bute is
with me; she is a most agreeable friend in all respects.” This was
Edward Wortley Montagu’s only sister, Mary, who was born in 1718,
whilst her father was ambassador to the Porte. She had married in 1736,
John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute.

[Page heading: A HIGH AND DRY RESIDENCE]

A long letter of Mrs. Montagu’s in reply to the duchess contains some
amusing descriptions of the trio--herself, Mrs. “Donn,” and the little
Père’s expeditions from Sandleford--

 “Yesterday we went to see a very extraordinary place. A gentleman
 has built a house on the summit of a prodigious hill, where there
 is not a drop of water nor a stick of wood; he has planted some fir
 trees which are watered every day by carts that bring the water
 about three miles; he has sunk a well to the centre of the earth,
 from whence some laborious horses draw him as much water as may
 wash his face, or in a liberal hour supply his tea kettle. The
 winds plays about his house in so riotous a manner, that a person
 must poise themselves in a very exact manner to maintain their
 ground and walk on two legs with an erect countenance as it is the
 glory and pride of human nature to do.... The first house this
 gentleman built was in a bottom, where the ground was all wet and
 marshy, overgrown with willows and alders and extremely peopled
 with frogs; there he found himself ill at ease, and no doubt but
 in time would have died of a dropsy, as I now fear he will be
 destroyed by a wind cholick.

 “A few days ago we were at Miss Lisle’s wood and grotto; the work
 of 9 sisters, who in disposition as well as number, bear some
 resemblance to the Muses. On Monday we think of going to Lady
 Fane’s[435] grotto.[436] Mrs. Donnellan and I are going to make a
 shell frame for a looking glass. I think a looking glass to be the
 properest for the first work, as everybody will be sure to find
 something they like in it.”

    [435] Mary Stanhope, widow of Charles, Viscount Fane, of Basildon;
    once Maid-of-Honour to Queen Anne.

    [436] At Basildon, still called “The Grotto.”

[Page heading: LADY FANE’S GROTTOES]

[Page heading: THE AXLETREE]

In the next letter of August 23 is the description of Lady Fane’s
grotto--

 “The situation is, like most grottoes, placed where a grotto would
 not be looked for: it joins to the house. Now having told its only
 defect, I will go on to the rest. The first room is fitted up
 entirely with shells, the sides and ceiling in beautiful mosaic, a
 rich cornice of flowers in baskets and cornucopias, and the little
 yellow sea snail is so disposed in shades as to resemble knots
 of ribbon which seem to tye up some of the bunches of flowers.
 There is a bed for the Hermit, which is composed of rich shells,
 and so shaded that the curtain seems folded and flowing.... The
 room adjoining it is the true and proper style for a grotto; it is
 composed of rough rock work in a very bold taste, the water falls
 down it into a cold bath. This grotto is about 50 yards from the
 Thames, to which the descent is very precipitate. From the Shell
 Room you have no advantage of the Thames, from the other room you
 have a view of it. The House to which this grotto is joined is
 a small habitation where Lady Fane used to pass a good deal of
 time. Lord Fane’s seat[437] is about a mile from it: it has not
 indeed the view of the Thames, but is finely situated in a bower
 of Beech Wood, and before it a pretty prospect. From the Grotto
 we went to a Wood by the Thames, where we sat and eat our cold
 dinner very comfortably. In the afternoon we walked up a hill
 which commands a fine prospect, the Thames winds about in the
 manner it does at Cliefden. There is a want of wood, as I think
 the country rather flat, but the prospect is very extensive; you
 see Oxford and Reading, one on the right, the other on the left
 hand. In our road thither one of the wheels took fire and burnt
 thro’ the axletree.... A wheelwright was apply’d to but he had been
 carousing at a christening, and was not in that degree of sober
 sense requisite to make even an axletree. A Justice of the peace
 whom the King had knighted lived hard by; to him we applyed for a
 coach, as it was part of his office to send vagrants to the place
 of their abode. Alas! his coach, which contrary to other things
 used to rest on the week days and work only on the Sabbath, had not
 been licensed, to the great inconvenience of his lady and the grief
 of Carter John, who one day in the week was a coachman.... What was
 to be done? The sun was declining, we were 20 miles from home....
 A good inn with the sign of the Blue Boar, Green Dragon, or Red
 Lion would have pleased us better than all we had seen, but--Alas!
 the only village within reach offered us a homely lodging under
 thatched roofs. We were a party of seven, and might have stormed
 the village with more ease than the French can Bergen-op-Zoom,
 but the plunder w’d not have given us a supper, or the place
 afforded us a lodging. But on finding the uncoached Justice was
 married to Sir Robert Sutton’s niece,[438] an acquaintance of Mrs.
 Donnellan’s, she sent her compliments, told our distress, and we
 were kindly received that night. The wheelwright slept himself
 sober, the next day made us an axletree, and we came home laughing
 at our adventures.”

[Page heading: SOUTHAMPTON]

The Montagus had projected a tour to Southampton for some time, and
towards the end of August they set out, accompanied by Dr. Courayer,
leaving Jack and William Robinson at Sandleford. Writing to the duchess
on September 22, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “We went from hence to Winchester, where we saw the Cathedral,
 attending Service on Sunday; it is a very neat Gothick building in
 so good repair that time seems rather to have made it venerable
 than old. The Choir is very handsome, there are many old monuments.
 Several of the Saxon Kings have their bones collected into a sort
 of Trunk.... William Rufus is interred there too, in a kind of
 stone chest; William of Wickham and Cardinal Beaufort bear their
 ensigns of the Prelatick order on their tombs, which are very
 handsome; but let us leave the pride of the dead for the luxury of
 the living, and go on to Mr. Dummer’s.[439] The gardens are pretty,
 and there is a fine lawn before the house, from whence there is
 a rich prospect and a distant sight of the river at Southampton,
 where we arrived pretty late in the evening. The next morning we
 surveyed the town, which I think is very pretty, but what most
 pleased me there, was the prospect from a little Round Tower from
 which one has the finest view imaginable, the sea and river most
 encompass it.... From hence we went to Mount Bevis;[440] your Grace
 knows it so well I shall not describe it.... What a noble Bason
 does the river form at the end of the Bowling Green! how fine a
 prospect from the Mount! Lord Peterborough[441] says in a letter
 to Mr. Pope in reference to Mount Bevis, ‘I confess the lofty
 Sacharissa at Stowe, but am content with my little Amoret.’ His
 Lordship had great reason to be content, for tho’ Stowe, like a
 court beauty, is adorn’d and ornamented with great expence, the
 native graces of Mount Bevis surprize and charm the beholder, and
 have an effect that art can never reach.... We spent a good deal of
 time in these charming gardens: went from them to Lyndhurst, one
 of the King’s houses in the New Forest, which house the Duke of
 Bedford lends to Mr. Medows.”[442]

    [439] Cranbury Park, near Hursley.

    [440] The seat of the great Earl of Peterborough, now incorporated
    into the town above Bar.

    [441] Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough, born 1658, died 1735.
    Soldier and diplomatist.

    [442] Brother-in-law of Mr. Montagu.

From three other letters, to Sarah Robinson, Mrs. Donnellan, and Dr.
Freind, I give paragraphs. Speaking of Mount Bevis, she says--

 “In a room on this Mount, Pope used to write, and I imagine he
 wrote his ‘Universal Prayer’ there, for the unbounded prospect
 leads the mind to the Great Author of all things, and to say to
 Him, ‘Whose Temple has all space, &c.’ There is a little recess in
 the wood where he used to study, and here perhaps he meditated his
 satires, for we are most apt to blame the crowd when we ourselves
 are out of the Tumult.”

[Page heading: THE NEW FOREST]

[Page heading: WILTON]

[Page heading: SAVERNAKE]

At Lyndhurst the Medowses took their guests to see the Forest--

 “saw Burleigh and Bolder Lodges, the one belongs to the Duke of
 Bolton, the other to Lord Delawarre. Saw the Forest, where there
 are (after great depredations), still some fine trees remaining....
 Went one day to Hurst Castle, which commands a full view of the
 Isle of Wight; we dined on our cold loaf in the room where King
 Charles was prisoner; it is a neat, strong castle but small--Harry
 Bellardine is governor of it. Another day we were carried to
 Beaulieu, a seat of the Duke of Montagu’s, the wood and water make
 it the finest summer situation imaginable. The house was part of an
 old Abbey,[443] and there are traces of the Monastery that show it
 was large. We saw a fine prospect of the River and Isle of Wight
 from a place called Exbury. From Lyndhurst we went to Salisbury; on
 the Sunday we went to the Cathedral and heard an excellent sermon
 from the Bishop of Lincoln. We received great civilities from the
 Bishop of Salisbury[444] and Mrs. Sherlock. I cannot describe
 Wilton,[445] it exceeds all that poetry and painting can represent.
 A fine lawn leads you to a charming river, on which there is a
 bridge, and such a bridge![446]... What sort of Bridge, say you?
 Why such a bridge as the gods would build to lead the souls of
 the Blessed from Lethe to Elysium if Charon would permit it. This
 leads to a fine hill covered with Nature’s verdant carpet adorned
 with fine plantations.... We descended from this hill and crossed
 the river again over another elegant building, and so returned to
 the house. The apartments are very noble, the Statues and busts
 are famous.... The rooms are very fine, and there is one which
 exceeds any I ever saw and which has in it the fine family piece
 by Vandyck; it really exceeded my expectation, the figures are
 so finely painted, their attitudes are gestures and their looks
 are speech; there are many other fine pictures. From Salisbury
 we directed our course to Stone Henge, which is an astonishing
 thing.... Thence we went to Amesbury,[447] where great improvements
 are making. There is a little river which winds about so as to make
 the place appear almost an island. There are three pretty Bridges,
 one in the manner of a Chinese house. The Duke of Queensborough has
 planted the hill very prettily. The house was a hunting box, built
 by Inigo Jones, the front handsome, the inside very small, only one
 fine room.

 “We got that night to Marlborough, early enough to walk in Lord
 Hertford’s garden.... Lord Hertford has made a pretty grotto.

 “From Marlborough we took our route to Lord Bruce’s,[448] the
 access to it is very noble, avenues planted or woods cut thro’ for
 a mile and a half before you reach the house. The house contains a
 great number of fine rooms richly gilt and adorned with handsome
 chimney pieces; there are many family pictures and some very good
 ones....

 “Dr. Courayer is still here.

 “My brother Tom was here three weeks. The Westminsters[449] are
 here, and they are admitted at Cambridge, so are now very happy.”


    [443] Founded in 1204 for Cistercians.

    [444] Thomas Sherlock, born 1678, died 1761: afterwards Bishop of
    London.

    [445] The Earl of Pembroke’s.

[Page heading: DR. COURAYER’S LETTER]

I copy a letter of Dr. Courayer’s here--

  “November, 1747.

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “C’est sans doute un mauvais Genie qui a fait trotter ma lettre
 par toute l’Angleterre, au lieu de l’addresser directement
 à Sandleford, et cela je pense dans le dessein de me mettre
 de mauvaise humeur en vous soupconnant d’indifference, ou de
 m’inquieter par des allarmes sur votre santé. Votre reponse a
 remedié au mal, et a exorcisé le mauvais esprit qui s’étoit ingeré
 de vouloir nous broüiller ou nous refroidir, mais qui n’a fait que
 decouvrir sa malice, sans rien produire de ce qu’il avoit eu en
 vüe. J’espere que cette lettre ci ne fera pas tant de circuits.

 “Je vous felicite de la continuation de la belle saison. Nous en
 avons eu notre part à Londres, et Dieu qui, comme vous le dites,
 fait luire son soleil sur les injustes comme sur les justes a moins
 consulté nos iniquités que sa misericorde. Je ne laisse pas d’etre
 un peu scandalisé de vos reproches. Croyez-vous donc qu’il n’y ait
 de saints que dans les villages, et nous mettez vous tous au rang
 des réprouvés? A la verité

    “‘Le monde a de fort grands defauts,
    Ne croyez pas que je l’excuse.
    Il est mechant, leger et faux,
    Il trompe, il seduit, il abuse.
    Il est auteur de mille maux,
    Mais tel qu’il est, il nous amuse.’

 Ainsi ne soyez pas surprise, si je ne suis pas aussi ennemi de la
 ville que vous pretendez l’être. Quand votre sort vous y ramenera,
 vous changerez de morale comme de demeure, et en quittant les
 Penates de Sandleford pour ceux de Londres, ce changement de place
 vous fera changer d’Idolatrie, et vous convaincra de l’injustice
 de vos declamations. Ce n’est pas après tout que je condamne votre
 goût pour la campagne.

    “‘La solitude est belle en vers,
    On est charmé de sa peinture.
    Mais elle a de facheux revers.
    Quelque bien qu’on soit, le temps dure,
    Et je vois dans cet univers,
    Qu’on aime à changer de posture.’

 “Je vous suis très obligé de l’offre que vous me faites d’ecrire ma
 vie, au lieu de mon Oraison funèbre. Mon amour propre trouve à se
 satisfaire dans ce Projet, et ce sera une chose egalement nouvelle
 et curieuse de voir la vie d’un Philosophe écrite de la main d’une
 Dame, qui n’approuve ni ses maximes ni ses inclinations. Mais quoi
 qu’il en puisse etre c’est trop d’honneur pour moi d’avoir une
 telle historiographe pour ne pas accepter votre offre; et quand
 bien meme j’aurois à essuyer quelque trait de satyre parmi les
 Eloges, je ne pourrois que vous savoir bon gré d’avoir voulu vous
 exercer sur un sujet dont le principal merite seroit d’avoir passé
 par vos mains.

 “Pour dire tout le mal que vous dites de vous même, vous avez sans
 doute des raisons que je n’ai pas pour le croire; et tant que je
 les ignorerai, je ne puis pas vous voir par d’autres yeux que par
 les miens. Mais puisque vous vous accusez d’etre si vaine, je dois
 vous taire ce que je pense de vous, de peur d’augmenter encore la
 vanité dont vous vous dites coupable. Restons chacun dans l’idée
 que nous avons, vous en serez plus humble, sans que je sente
 diminuer pour vous mon amitié et mon estime.

 “Le Duc et la Duchesse de Portland sont venus ici pour la
 naissance du Roi. Ils repartirent hier pour Bullstrode, où je
 vous conseillerois volontiers lorsque Mr. Montagu vous aura
 quittée d’aller passer quelque temps. Vous y auriez un peu plus de
 compagnie, et la votre ne gateroit rien à la leur.

 “Mrs. Donnellan sera ici demain ou le jour d’après. J’ai toujours
 regardé la promesse qu’elle vous avoit faite comme un compliment
 sans consequence, et je n’ai pu m’imaginer qu’elle put revenir de
 King’s Weston qu’en compagnie, ce qui lui ôteroit la liberté de
 vous voir.

 “Je suis très obligé à Mr. Montagu et à Miss Robinson de leur
 souvenir. Mes amitiés à l’un et à l’autre. Independamment de ce que
 je leur dois, il suffit qu’ils vous appartiennent, pour qu’ils me
 soient chers.

 “Voici, Madame, une longue lettre. Peut etre vous ennuyera-t-elle?
 En ce cas jettez la au feu avant que d’en achever la lecture. Une
 autre fois je serai plus court, et me contenterai de vous dire que
 je vous aime autant que vous le meritez, c’est à dire beaucoup, et
 que je suis très sincerement tout à vous.

  “LE COURAYER.

  “À Londres, ce 3 Novembre, 1747.”

[Page heading: MATTHEW ROBINSON’S ELECTION]

Matthew Robinson had been returned member for Canterbury with little
opposition. In writing to her father to press his visiting at
Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu begs him to leave his canvasses, but bring
his painting materials. “We will provide all possible conveniences for
your work, and you may create immortal plants, clouds that will never
dissolve in rain, nor be chased by wind, and suns that shine larger
than in the miraculous days of Joshua.” She also thanks him for Hoyle’s
book on Chess, and Taylor’s on Perspective, and some drop medicine
called “Devil’s Drops,” which Mrs. Montagu alludes to as having “a
quality that makes one less fit for conversation than the Vapours
themselves!”

Matthew Robinson writes from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to his father as
to his young brothers William and John. William was at St. John’s, and
John at Trinity Hall. Both matriculated most creditably. William[450]
was said to be the best scholar of the year of his college, and John’s
tutor had a high opinion of his talent. Matthew addresses his father
“Honoured Sir.”

    [450] William became soon an intimate friend of the poet Gray.

[Page heading: LORD LYTTELTON’S “MONODY”]

Parliament being summoned for November 10, Mr. Montagu set out, but
very unwillingly, as his wife had been suffering much from “spasms of
the stomach,” a complaint she was much plagued with. In a letter of
November 14 he promises to send a pamphlet on Lord Lovat’s trial, and
Mr. Lyttelton’s verses. This latter was the celebrated Monody which he
wrote after the death of his first wife, _née_ Lucy Fortescue, who had
died on January 19 of this year, leaving him with two children--Thomas,
afterwards 2nd Baron Lyttelton, and Lucy, who married Arthur, Viscount
Valentia.

Mr. Montagu, accompanied by his neighbour, Mr. Herbert, of Highclere,
inspected his new house in Hill Street, which was then being
ornamented, and with which he was not pleased. They then proceeded to
see Lord Chesterfield’s house, which was nearing completion. He says
“his principal apartment, which is on the ground floor, will be very
magnificent.”

Mrs. Donnellan writes on November 17--

 “I went with Mrs. Southwell[451] on Saturday to _King Lear_ to see
 Garrick and Mrs. Cibber, both performed extremely well. I think
 he took the part of the old testy madman better than the Hero,
 and Mrs. Cibber is the soft, tender Cordelia in perfection. I am
 only provoked that they have altered Shakespear’s plain, sincere,
 artless creation into a whining, love-sick maid. I would have an
 Act of Parliament, at least of Council, that nobody should add a
 word to Shakespear, for it makes sad patchwork....

 “I have read Mr. Lyttelton’s ‘Monody;’ ’tis moving and seems to
 speak the feeling heart.... Madame ‘Gran’(ville) desires her duty,
 she is sorry you are not in town, there was a charming execution
 yesterday--two smugglers and a Jew, and a fine view from her
 windows.”

    [451] Wife of the Right Hon. Edward Southwell.

Mrs. Montagu’s health being extremely delicate, she was ordered to
Bath, accompanied by her husband and sister. They stayed at Mrs.
Purdie’s, Orange Court. In a letter of December 28, to Mrs. Donnellan,
she says--

 “The day after I came I consulted Dr. Hartley;[452] he gave me
 comfortable words, said mine was a Bath case, would be cured by
 the waters, but medicines were improper and dangerous, and neither
 ordered bolus, draughts, or electuary, or any of the warlike stores
 of the faculty. The waters do not disagree with me, nor have I
 been ill since I came in any violent degree. My spirits are not in
 the best order, which you will not wonder at when I tell you my
 brother Tom[453] has a miliary fever; Dr. Wilmot does not perceive
 any danger at present, but cannot pronounce him safe till the fever
 leaves him.”

    [452] Dr. David Hartley, born 1705, died 1757; physician,
    philosopher, and writer.

    [453] Her second brother, admitted to Lincoln’s Inn, April 14, 1730.

[Page heading: THOMAS ROBINSON’S DEATH]

Alas! poor Tom died on December 29; his hitherto brilliant career being
cut short, my grandfather, Matthew, 4th Baron Rokeby, says, “by a cold
caught by being overheated in a pleading before the House of Commons.”
He was a young man so promising in his profession that the then Chief
Justice of the King’s Bench exclaimed, “We have lost the man in
England for a point of law.” His treatise[454] on Gavelkind still
continues to be the standard book on that subject. In sprightliness of
wit and fertility of invention he much resembled his sister. He left
on Mrs. Montagu’s recollection “an indelible impression of admiration,
and a regret which no subsequent acquisition in friendship could
sufficiently compensate.”

    [454] “The Common Law of Kent,” or “The Customs of Gavelkind, with
    an Appendix concerning Borough English,” 1st edition, 1741; 2nd at
    a date I have not been able to ascertain; 3rd in 1822; 4th in 1858.
    Edited by J. D. Norwood, of Ashford.

[Year: 1748]

In writing to Mrs. Donnellan soon after, she says--

 “My poor brother’s virtues and capacity gave me the fairest hopes
 of seeing him enjoy life with great advantages; a fatal moment
 has destroyed those hopes, but it must be length of time that can
 make me submit to the cruel disappointment; he was an honour and
 happiness to us all, and I never thought of him without pleasure.”

[Page heading: BATH]

In a letter to Mrs. Donnellan from Bath, dated February 6, the
following passage occurs: “The Coffee House is really grown sprightly.
We meet Mrs. Pitt,[455] Mrs. G. Trevor, Mrs. Grosvenor, Lady Lucy
Stanhope, and a few more, and we are often very merry, and sit round
the fire after other people go away.”[456] The Freinds were at Bath,
but their little boy Robert being inoculated for the smallpox kept the
cousins apart.

    [455] Anne Pitt, sister of Mr. Pitt, Maid-of-Honour to Queen
    Caroline.

    [456] The “Coffee House” apparently adjoined the Rooms, as is
    shown in the reproduction of Nixon’s original water-colour drawing
    of such a scene as Mrs. Montagu describes, now in Mr. Broadley’s
    valuable Bath Collection.

Her spirits reviving, Mrs. Montagu, writing to the duchess, says,
“Whisk and the noble game of E. O. employ the evening; three glasses
of water, a toasted roll, a Bath cake, and a cold walk the mornings,”
but the regimen agreed with her, and she accompanied Mr. Montagu to
Sandleford on May 1, leaving Sarah Robinson, who was suffering from
headache, with her friend, Miss Grinfield, at Bath. From this period
dates the extreme intimacy which grew up between Miss Robinson and Lady
Barbara Montagu, sister of George Montagu Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax,
who was then living at Bath, and invited Miss Robinson to stay with her.

The Hill Street house not being completed, Mrs. Knight,[457] a cousin
of the family, lent Mrs. Montagu her house in Golden Square, London.
Miss Grinfield, just mentioned, was just made a dresser to the
princesses, daughters of George II.

    [457] _Née_ Robinson.

 “Miss Grinfield is in waiting.... The place is enough to weary a
 person of the strongest constitution; their Highnesses rise early
 and go to bed late; are waited upon by the dressers at dinner.
 Princess Caroline[458] has one to read to her continually; poor
 Nancy is to have only the £100 per annum, and no cloathes till one
 goes off.”

    [458] Married 1766, to King Christian VII. of Denmark.

[Page heading: MISS M. ANSTEY]

In the same letter Mrs. Montagu mentions Miss M. Anstey[459] had been
staying with her, but her parents insisted on her returning to them to
help furnish Trumpington, near Cambridge, a property they had just come
into.

    [459] Sister of the author of the “New Bath Guide.”

[Page heading: CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY]

From the Middletons, Mrs. Montagu writes to Mrs. Donnellan--

  “Cambridge, June 15.

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “As I date my letter from the modern capital of the Muses, you will
 perhaps expect that I should send you some strains of immortal
 poetry, but I have not yet met with any such thing, and must rather
 give an account of the Buildings than the literary works of the
 University. I had some pleasure in the recollection of the easy
 careless years of infancy, some part of which I passed here with
 the most tender of relations, a fond grandmother; in comparison
 of whose indulgence all other indulgence is severity, as you must
 be sensible if ever you had the greatest of infant comforts, a
 grandmother. So much to my particular circumstances; then, to
 the general situation of the University. The Colleges do not in
 general, stand so as to give ornament to the town, as those of
 Oxford, but if the town is the worse for it, the Colleges are the
 better, as they open to the fields, and from thence receive and
 give a fine prospect. King’s College, Clare Hall, and Trinity
 Library, and the finest of Gothick buildings--King’s College
 Chapel, makes a beautiful appearance from the public walks. Trinity
 College is a most noble thing; the Quadrangle is a sixth part
 bigger than that of Christchurch in Oxford. The Library is very
 handsome, and esteemed one of the finest rooms in the World. In the
 Library there is preserved the skeleton of a gentleman who left his
 bones as a monument of his regard to mankind on purpose to instruct
 even the most superficial observer of the formation of the human
 body, and at the same time designed that his name, like his body,
 might be snatched from the grave; how various are the roads to
 Fame! Some seek them by grand and pompous obsequies; others expect
 them for not having Christian burial, and hope to be remembered
 by a magnificent tomb, or the want of a coffin. I always thought
 vanity the very marrow of a human creature, and it sticks to them
 even to their very bones.... What gives me the greatest pleasure is
 the seeing Dr. Middleton married to a person[460] who seems formed
 to make him happy; she is very well bred and agreeable, has a most
 obliging temper, likes his manner of life, shows him the greatest
 regard, and among her accomplishments I must take notice of her
 playing on the Harpsichord in great perfection.

 “I found two brothers very well, and extremely happy in their
 situation.”

    [460] Anne Powell, his third wife.

[Page heading: RICHARDSON’S “CLARISSA”]

She then continues that, Master Knight having taken smallpox, she
cannot go back to Golden Square, but into two bedrooms in her
unfinished house in Hill Street. This sentence shows that Mrs.
Donnellan was a friend of Mr. Samuel Richardson, the great author: “I
wish you much pleasure with the nightingales at North End, and you have
a good right to be of so harmonious a society.” North End, near Fulham,
was Mr. Richardson’s[461] country house. He had published “Pamela”
in 1740, and “Clarissa Harlowe,” which was to make such a lasting
sensation, was published in this spring of 1748.

    [461] Samuel Richardson, born 1689, died 1761. Novelist and
    publisher; wrote “Sir Charles Grandison,” etc., etc.

[Page heading: PEACE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE]

Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister, who was still at Bath on June
25, from Hill Street, where, as she states, everything is in great
confusion, “the middle floors not laid.” Mrs. Dettemere, her
lady’s-maid, had just lost her husband, whom she had not seen for
years, but loved dearly. She appears to have been a poor lady, but the
cause of her living separate from her husband does not appear. Dr.
Shaw had been consulted as to a return of Mrs. Montagu’s spasms of the
stomach, and recommended the extraordinary remedy of “sweating.” This
was to remain in bed for days and weeks in flannel sheets, which at
midsummer could have hardly been endured. She says--

 “He assures me I shall neither be sick or nervous: after my
 sweating fit is over, I am to drink asses’ milk, ride on horseback,
 and grow fat and jolly. I am now thinner than ever, so the
 reformation will be greater if I grow fat.... My brother Robinson
 had a very pleasant journey to Aix, where I daresay he will have a
 great deal of pleasure. There will be a great concourse of people
 of all nations, and Lord and Lady Sandwich are extremely obliging
 to him....

 “Mr. Flower sent your jumps[462] yesterday; I did not pay for them
 on account of his raising the price.”

    [462] A sort of stays.

The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had been signed in March, Lord Sandwich
and Sir Thomas Robinson[463] being the English plenipotentiaries.
Lady Sandwich, going out to join her husband, persuaded Mr. Matthew
Robinson, who was a great friend, to escort her to Aix-la-Chapelle.

    [463] “Short Sir Thomas Robinson,” called in contradistinction to
    “Long” Sir T. Robinson, Mrs. Montagu’s cousin.

In order to while away the weary hours of lying in bed at Sandleford,
Miss Anstey and Dettemere had to read aloud to Mrs. Montagu Admiral
Anson’s book, “A Voyage round the World,” recently published. Sarah
Robinson designated it “as the best receipt book in England as far as
dressing turtles and some Indian animals can reach.”

Mrs. Donnellan had lost her stepfather, Mr. Percival, on April 26 of
this year. He had long been in declining health. She was very anxious
about the remedy Mrs. Montagu was taking, and demanded constant news.
She recommends Townsend’s “Translation of the Conquest of Mexico” to be
read to Mrs. Montagu. Her mother, she writes, had taken a house for the
summer months “a little beyond the walls of Kensington gardens, and I
have a key to the nearest door.”

Dr. Shaw is mentioned as going away on his travels, leaving no
directions for his patients, and the Duchess of Portland as giving him
£600 to enable him to travel and find her shells and curiosities, for
which she had an insatiable appetite.

Sarah Robinson continued at Bath with Lady Bab Montagu, and hints
are thrown out in some of the letters of an attachment springing up
between her and Mr. G. L. Scott, mentioned before. Captain Pigott,
an admirer of Sarah’s, is described as “dressed according to custom
in a tied wig fresh powdered, a bloom colour cloth coat, laced most
magnificently with gold, and bloom-coloured stockings; he visits our
door continually, but all the consequence is a little expense in chair
hire to him.”

Two people with immense trains of attendants are noticed as then at
Bath, the Earl of Harrington[464] and Earl of Hertford,[465] the
latter “never stirs without three footmen, and his very chair men have
shoulder knots.”

    [464] William Stanhope, 1st Earl of Harrington; Viceroy of Ireland.

    [465] 15th Earl, afterwards Duke of Somerset.

[Page heading: SPA]

Three letters of Matthew Robinson to his sister from the Continent
whilst with Lord and Lady Sandwich contain a few interesting
paragraphs--

 “After my last letter we set out for Spa, whither we travelled
 through the Dutchy of Limburg, a most beautiful country to look
 at, and among the rest we saw to the left the Forest of Arden
 where Jacques moralized, but though it is about 80 miles in
 circumference, by means of bad government and its revenues being
 carried to its Princess, the Empress, to Vienna its capital,
 Limburg is a pitiful village and in the whole Dutchy there are
 not above 4 or 5 other villages, still more contemptible. At Spa
 we lived a very merry life, and were entertained by an Hungarian
 Prince and other German nobility. Tokay and other very good wines
 gave us a taste how very fine a country Hungary must be, but our
 scheme was unluckily cut short in the middle by Lord Sandwich
 having a sudden call to Aix. Upon our return Sir Thomas Robinson
 was here, who at his Lordship’s request is joined with him as
 second plenipotentiary; he says he is an old familiar of my
 Father’s, and inquires much after him. Our life here is as it used
 to be. The Sunday before last there was a most magnificent gala,
 a dinner, supper and ball at the French ambassador’s on account
 of St. Louis’ day, where I assure you I was much charm’d with the
 unaffected liveliness and gaiety of the French.... Last Sunday we
 had a second part of the same comedy by the Dutch on account of the
 Prince of Orange’s birthday; besides a dinner and supper, there was
 a ball at the Maison de Ville, which of itself is very magnificent,
 and was finely decorated by Mr. Vanharen. Lady Sandwich both in her
 journey and here has often wished for your company.... To-morrow
 morning I set out for Bonn upon the Rhine, and we go from thence
 all down the Rhine to the Hague.”

[Page heading: THE HAGUE]

Matthew and a Mr. Gee left Lord and Lady Sandwich at Aix. Young Edward
Wortley Montagu was acting-secretary to Lord Sandwich. From the Hague
he writes in October--

 “Since I wrote to you last I have taken a long and pleasant journey
 up the Rhine among the palaces of the four Electors, from thence I
 am come to the Hague, about 10 days ago. From the neatness of the
 town, the incomparable walks and rides about it, its rendezvous of
 Ministers and politicks, it is a very agreeable place to live in.
 The Ministers here by turns hold assemblies of the men at their
 houses, morning and evening, and I have dined at the house of one
 or other of them almost every day. The court is well filled and
 well attended, but as formal as our own.... The most extraordinary
 person here is Mr. Grounen, the Father of Mrs. Trevor, wife of
 our envoy, who has knowledge and sense enough to be mighty well
 acquainted with the History of Europe, and to be supposed by
 some people to be writing the History of his own times, to have
 constantly every noon about him a resort of the Ministers and best
 company here, to be the center of all their news, and to be the
 particular and intimate acquaintance of several great men, and
 among the rest the correspondent of Lord Chesterfield, and yet at
 the same time to be so mad as for fear of infection literally not
 to touch any human creature, neither his servants, his children,
 nor even his second wife!”

[Page heading: DEATH OF MR. JAMES MONTAGU]

Mr. James Montagu, half-brother to Mr. Edward Montagu, had for some
time been deaf, and was now in a very dropsical state; he now fell very
ill. Mr. and Mrs. Montagu nursed him tenderly till the end, which took
place on October 30. From letters of Mrs. Medows to Mrs. Montagu one
learns the brothers had not been brought up together; hence the blow
was less acutely felt. He appears to have died in London. His estate
of Newbold Verdon in Leicestershire was left to Wortley Montagu. Mrs.
Medows says, “I can’t help feeling a little hurt that Newbold goes
where it should not, but I really believe Sandleford is a pleasanter
place to live in.”

In a letter to Sarah, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “Mr. Montagu is now returned from the melancholy ceremony of
 opening the will. My brother has left us a handsome legacy, and
 also all his plate and jewels, which last, he told the person who
 made the codicil, would be proper for me, as I had refused any when
 I married, perhaps his brother would forget them. I hear the plate
 is valued at £1500, and the jewels, they say, are fine, but I never
 saw them. I esteem the good will and kindness of the donor more
 than ever I shall the glittering gems.”

The two sailor brothers had just returned from the East Indies.

 “Charles grown from a fine boy to a very clever man, he is improved
 in all respects.... My house looks like an Indian warehouse: I
 have got so many figures, jars, etc., etc., you would laugh at
 the collection, my gown I brought out of the ship buckled under
 my jumps, it is very pretty and the work extremely neat. The
 Captain has brought China, Lutestrings, taffeties and Paduasoys,
 they wear so well, but the colors are not as good as those of our
 manufacture.”

[Page heading: PRICE OF TEA]

Tea was also brought, and Dr. Conyers Middleton had 4 lbs. at 16_s._ a
pound. He had just brought out his “Free Enquiry into the Miraculous
Powers.” Matthew Robinson writes of it on December 17, “Middleton will
tell you there is no belief to be given to any of the miracles related
by the Fathers, Hume[466] says that there is no belief to be given to
miracles related by any man whatsoever.” And thus end the letters of
1748.

    [466] David Hume, born 1711, died 1776; philosopher and historian.




CHAPTER VIII.

 1749–1751--SOCIETY IN LONDON AND AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS--BEGINNING OF
 CORRESPONDENCE WITH GILBERT WEST, AND RESIDENCE AT HAYES.


[Year: 1749]

An account of a subscription masquerade given at Ranelagh in May opens
the letters of 1749. My grandfather[467] by mistake put this in 1751.
It succeeded a magnificent fête and masquerade given on May 1 in
celebration of the Peace.

    [467] _Vide_ Horace Walpole’s letter to Sir H. Mann, vol. ii. p.
    292.

Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister at Bath on May 8--

 “I am ashamed that I have been so remiss in writing to my dear
 sister, but business and amusements have poured in torrents upon
 me. I was some days preparing for the subscription masquerade,
 where I was to appear in the character of the Queen Mother,[468]
 my dress white satin, fine new point for tuckers, kerchief and
 ruffles, pearl necklace and earrings, and pearls and diamonds
 on the head, and my hair curled after the Vandyke picture. Mrs.
 Trevor[469] and the Lady Stanhopes’[470] adjusted my dress, so that
 I was one day in my life well dressed.

 “Miss Charlotte Fane was Rubens’ wife, and looked extremely well;
 we went together. Miss Chudleigh’s[471] dress or rather undress was
 remarkable. She was Iphigenia for the sacrifice, but so naked, the
 High Priest might easily inspect the entrails of the victim. The
 Maids of Honour, not of maids the strictest, were so offended they
 would not speak to her.

    [468] Henrietta Maria.

    [469] Mrs. John Morley Trevor, _née_ Montagu.

    [470] Daughters of 1st Viscount Stanhope; their mother was a Pitt.

    [471] Maid-of-Honour, and secretly married to Viscount Bristol,
 afterwards Duchess of Kingston.

 “Pretty Mrs. Pitt[472] looked as if she came from heaven, but was
 only on her road thither in the habit of a chanoiness. Many ladies
 looked handsome, and others rich, there was as great a quantity
 of Diamonds as the town could produce. Mrs. Chandler was a starry
 night, the Duchess of Portland had no jewels, and was miserably
 dressed. Lord Sandwich made a fine Hussar. Mr. Montagu has made me
 lay by my dress to be painted in when I see Mr. Hoare again. His
 picture is thought like, but the face too full for my thin jaws. I
 staid till 5 o’clock in the morning at the masquerade, and was not
 tired, but a glass of your champagne and water gave me a fit of the
 cholick the next day, and I have never been well since, but I had
 better luck than Miss Conway[473] who was killed by a draught of
 Lemonade she drank there....

 “I suppose you have read Lord Bolingbroke’s new work,[474] as it is
 short we idle ones in London can find time to peruse it.”

    [472] _Née_ Penelope Atkyns, wife of George Pitt, afterwards Lord
    Rivers.

    [473] Miss Jenny Conway, sister of Lord Conway.

    [474] “The Idea of a Patriot King.”

Mrs. Montagu paid a visit to the Bothams at Albury soon after this.
From the letters it appears Mr. Matthew Robinson was pressing a suit
on Miss Godschall, a rich heiress living near Albury, but it came to
nothing.

In June, Mrs. Montagu, being recommended to drink the Tunbridge waters,
was accompanied by Lady Sandwich, who was also ordered there; Mr.
Montagu remaining on business for a while in London, Sarah Robinson
still living with Lady Bab Montagu at Bath.

A letter from Lady Talbot welcoming them to stay with her till
they found a house now appears. She was the wife of William, 2nd
Baron Talbot, afterwards Earl Talbot and Baron Dinevor, _née_ Mary
de Cardonnel, a great heiress, who had been married at the age of
fifteen! An amiable, affectionate person, and a great friend of Mrs.
Montagu’s. Mrs. Montagu writes for her chariot to be sent to her; she
and Lady Sandwich having performed the journey in Lady Sandwich’s
post-chaise,[475] then a new vehicle.

    [475] The four-wheeled post-chaise invented by Mr. Jethro Tull.

[Page heading: JOHN, DUKE OF MONTAGU]

They stayed three weeks drinking the waters, during which Lady Talbot
had a bad fall from her horse. A report reaching Tunbridge Wells that
Lord Sandwich had a fever, his wife, accompanied by Mrs. Montagu,
drove in four hours to London, where they found him recovered by the
taking of bark. As Lady Sandwich wished to be present at the Huntingdon
races, she did not return to Tunbridge, but Mrs. Montagu persuaded her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows, to accompany her there for a week. Mr.
Montagu now joined her from Sandleford, whither he had been accompanied
by Captain Robert Robinson, the sailor brother. The captain proceeded
on to Bath to see Sarah. Before leaving town, Mr. Montagu had been much
distressed at the illness of his relative, the Duke of Montagu, and
sent daily to inquire after him. He had only been at Tunbridge a few
days before the duke died, and he was summoned to town as an executor,
together with the Dukes of Bedford and Devonshire. Mrs. Montagu writes--

 “I am grieved at the heart for the poor Duke of Montagu, as he was
 your friend and the friend of mankind; his memory will be dear to
 all that knew him, he is embalmed in the tears of the poor and the
 distressed: it is happier to dye lamented than to live unloved.”

This is the Duke of Montagu[476] mentioned by Horace Walpole, page 141
of his letters to George Montagu, “as the head of all the ‘cues.’”[477]
In the codicils legacies were left to his servants, dogs, and cats.
Horace says, “As he was making the codicil one of his cats jumped on
his knee. ‘What,’ says he, ‘have you a mind to be a witness too? You
can’t, for you are a party concerned.’”

    [476] John Montagu, 2nd Duke, born 1705, died February 16, 1749.

    [477] The “cues” was the nickname of the large Montagu circle.

He left no male heir, only two daughters, the Duchess of Manchester,
who had remarried Mr. Hussey, and Lady Cardigan. Their mother was the
fourth daughter of the celebrated Duke of Marlborough.

[Page heading: MRS. VESEY]

Mr. Montagu got £100 as executor. Whilst he was detained in London,
Mrs. Montagu made an expedition to Coombe Bank in company of Mr. and
Mrs. Vesey. This is the first mention of people who were destined to
become most intimate friends. Mrs. Vesey was the daughter of Sir Thomas
Vesey, Bishop of Ossory. She married, first, Mr. William Handcock;
secondly, her cousin, Agmondesham Vesey, of Lucan, Ireland. He was M.P.
for Harris Town.

[Page heading: THE FEATHER SCREEN]

Mrs. Montagu writes--

 “I went yesterday along with Mrs. Vesey to see General Campbell’s
 place; we set out to avoid heat a little after 6. Lady Allen lent
 us her coach and six. We got to Coombe Banke by nine. It is about
 16 miles[478] from here. We walked about the gardens, which are
 very pretty, and saw the house, dined under the shade, and about
 4 o’clock Mr. and Mrs. Vesey got into their post-chaise to go to
 London. I mounted my horse and went to Senoak, where Lady Allen’s
 coach waited for me. Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson were just come to
 the inn, and going to dine on turtle, to which they invited me, but
 I had made a more agreeable meal in General Campbell’s garden....
 I am going to dinner to Lady Talbot’s, where I breakfasted. Lord
 Sandwich and Lord and Lady Anson and a great deal of company are
 to dine there. We have now such a crowd we expect a splendid ball
 to-night. I received great civility from Mr. and Mrs. Vesey, and
 they desired to know how I got home last night, so I must beg you
 to send the enclosed note to them in Bolton Row. They desired leave
 to see the house and celebrated feather screen, so I have wrote
 to Betty to have the house in order, and to set the screen for
 them.... Coombank is but a small place, but a fine terrace commands
 a beautiful view of the country. The house is most elegantly
 furnished. We were offered everything as politely as if the General
 had been there. We had a fine dessert of fruit served in the finest
 china. Our dinner we carried, but wine, tea and coffee were offered
 us.”

    [478] Three hours doing sixteen miles shows the badness of the
    roads.

This feather screen was in six panels, one of which was worked by Miss
Anstey, in imitation of one of the Duchess of Portland’s. The feather
work, immortalized afterwards by the poet Cowper, had been begun,
but it was the Duchess of Portland’s original idea. Numerous letters
mention feathers being sent or asked for. Lydia Botham collected the
plumage of peacocks, pheasants, and jays. Every known sort of parrot
and macaw was placed under contribution. From Albury the boxes of
feathers were sent by the Guildford coach to the “White Horse cellar in
Piccadilly.” With these came fifty pens made by Lydia from her geese.

Dr. Jurin[479] kept Mrs. Montagu longer than she intended drinking the
waters of Tunbridge. During her stay there amongst the company were the
Duchess of Somerset[480] and her daughter the Duchess of Bedford, Lord
and Lady Fitzwalter, Lady Ancram, Lady Anson, Lord and Lady Elibank,
Dowager Lady Barrington, Lady Betty Germain, Lord and Lady Vere
Beauclerk, Lady Talbot, Lord March, Lord Eglinton, Lord Granby and Lord
Powis, Lady Winchelsea, the Bishop of London and Mrs. Sherlock.

    [479] Dr. James Jurin, born 1684, died 1750; physician,
    mathematician and author.

    [480] Second wife of Charles, “the proud Duke” of Somerset. Her
    daughters became, one Marchioness of Granby, the other Countess of
    Aylesford.

In a letter to Dr. Freind this is said--

 “In many respects this place is inferior to Bath, in some it
 is better. We are not confined here in Streets; the houses are
 scattered irregularly, and Tunbridge Wells looks from the window I
 now sit by a little like the village[481] you see from our terrace
 at Sandleford, only that the inhabitants instead of Jack and Joan
 are my Lord and my Lady.”

    [481] Newtown.

[Page heading: HINCHINBROOK]

A letter of September 28, of Mr. Montagu’s, after his return to London,
is addressed to Hinchinbrook, where his wife had gone to stay with Lady
Sandwich for a grand ball at Huntingdon, and the election of a new
mayor. He says--

 “I am not surprised that Hinchinbrook pleases you so well, or that
 you are of opinion it is capable of being made a fine place, it
 stands upon an eminence and commands a fine prospect, which those
 that made the Terrass well knew. The venerable old elms in the road
 are very ornamental, and the wood at the bottom of the garden is
 pretty as is also the plantation in the Park. The brook from whence
 the place takes its name is at a due distance from the house, and
 might be improved into a river or fine piece of water. I doubt not
 my Lord will do it, if not at present, at an age more suitable.
 The room where Oliver Cromwell was born I daresay Mr. Audley will
 be proud to show you, and is seen by all strangers, tho’ I don’t
 believe it consists of one of the same particles of the material of
 which the room was built when that great man was brought into the
 world.”

[Page heading: THE MISS GUNNINGS]

Mrs. Montagu writes--

 “The Huntingdon ball was more splendid than I expected. I danced
 with Lord Sandwich. For beauties we had the two Miss Gunnings,[482]
 who are indeed very handsome; _nonpareille_, for the sisters are
 just alike take them together, and there is nothing like them; they
 are really very fine girls.”

    [482] The daughters of John Gunning, of Castle Coote, Roscommon.
    Elizabeth married, first, the Duke of Hamilton; secondly, the Duke
    of Argyll. Maria married the Earl of Coventry. There was a third
    sister, Kitty, married Mr. Robert Travers, but lived in Ireland.

On her road back to London she stayed with the Ansteys at Trumpington,
and Miss Anstey accompanied her to London.

Sarah Robinson, between whom and Mrs. Montagu there was a slight
estrangement on account of her engagement to Mr. George Lewis Scott,
which Mrs. Montagu disapproved of, now paid her sister a visit.
Matthew wrote to recommend that the sisters should meet as if nothing
had occurred to weaken their bond of affection. Sarah’s health had
improved much by her long residence at Bath with Lady Barbara Montagu,
who accompanied her on her visit to Sandleford. Sarah had painted
a toilette-cover with flowers for Mrs. Montagu’s new house in Hill
Street, which was beginning to be decorated.

In November, Parliament called the Montagus to London.


[Year: 1750]

[Page heading: MRS. MONTAGU’S CHINESE ROOM]

[Page heading: A CLERGYMAN’S CHILDREN]

The first letter of 1750 is dated January 3, from Sandleford, addressed
to Sarah. I give portions of it--

 “Lady Sandwich was so good as to spend a week with us, and as
 the weather was fine for this time of year, we went out in the
 post-chaise all the morning, then dinner, tea and supper pretty
 well filled the rest of the time. On Monday I went with her
 Ladyship to Reading, where we lay that night. The next morning she
 went to town, and I returned hither, where I found my brothers,
 who give me a very agreeable account of your health ... I saw our
 friend Cotes the day before I left town, she is very well and in
 good spirits, and seems determined to keep her freedom and enter
 no more into wedlock’s bonds. She has only a small lodging, and
 I think with her economy she might afford herself a house of her
 own, and she might furnish it in the present fashion, of some
 cheap paper and ornaments of Chelsea China or the manufacture of
 Bow, which makes a room look neat and finished. They are not so
 sumptuous as mighty Pagodas of China or nodding Mandarins. My
 dressing room in London is like the Temple of some Indian god: if
 I was remarkably short and had a great head, I should be afraid
 people would think I meant myself Divine Honours, but I can so
 little pretend to the embonpoint of a Josse, it is impossible to
 suspect me of such presumption. The very curtains are Chinese
 pictures on gauze, and the chairs the Indian fan sticks with
 cushions of Japan satin painted: as to the beauty of colouring,
 it is carried as high as possible, but the toilette you were so
 good as to paint is the only thing where nature triumphs. Lady
 Sandwich brought her sons here, they are charming boys; Lord
 Hinchinbrooke[483] is much improved since you saw him, and Master
 Montagu[484] is a complete beauty....

 “Mr. Morgan is at last deprived of the curacy of Newtown, which
 is a great grief to him. Nanny performs extremely well at the
 embroidery, and I hope the habit of application will make her
 useful to herself and other people. I was afraid she would never
 have been either of those things! Her Father and Mother are much
 afraid she should be buried in Westminster Abbey near the lady that
 dyed by the pinch of her finger in working, but I will lay some
 wager on her head she will not be killed by diligence; as to Jacky
 Morgan, he has an admirable education for a jockey, he lives on
 horseback but can neither read nor write.”

    [483] John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, born 1744.

    [484] Edward Montagu, born 1745; Mrs. Montagu’s godson.

This passage shows the position of the lower class of clergy of the
period. Mr. Morgan was of Welsh birth, and preached long, dull sermons,
as appears from former letters; his wife was a good motherly body, but
no more. Mrs. Montagu apprenticed Nanny Morgan, as is shown by her next
letter.

 “She is too high and too giddy for a servant, time and experience
 may mend her, she likes the business she is going to.... I have
 obliged Mrs. Albert to promise she shall never go without her
 or Dettmere[485] or Mrs. Donnellan’s maid.... Charles went to
 Cambridge on Tuesday.”

    [485] Mrs. Montagu’s lady’s-maid.

Charles’s health had improved, but as he did not like the sea as a
profession, he entered Cambridge as an undergraduate.

 “Tell Mr. Hoare when you see him, that if he pleases to send my
 face[486] to Hill Street, it will meet with a kind reception;
 it is a young face to be sure, but the retrospect to 18 is so
 pleasant I shall not find fault with it. I am, as you observe,
 Mistress of a post-chaize, which next to having wings, is the most
 convenient thing in the world, and must serve till it is brought to
 perfection. We liked so well our journey to Cambridge in the summer
 in a post-chaize which we hired for the time, that we bespoke one
 immediately.”

    [486] Her portrait by Hoare.

The old post-chaises had only two wheels. Four-wheeled post-chaises
were new, and were thought the more dangerous, as being liable to
overturn.

[Page heading: LORD PEMBROKE’S DEATH]

A letter occurs now from the Duchess Dowager of Chandos, third wife,
and widow since 1744, of the 1st Duke of Chandos, surnamed the
“Princely Duke,” the builder of the palatial residence of Canons, in
Middlesex, on which he spent £200,000. Having spent his fortune in
building and speculating, Canons was sold for the _material_ at his
death. The duchess’s maiden name was Van Hatten, but she had been
married to a Sir Thomas Davall. After the duke’s death she came to
reside at Shaw House,[487] near Newbury, from whence she writes to Mrs.
Montagu, and after some inquiries as to health, etc., says--

 “What different tempers the world consists of: I am told passion
 sent the late Lord Pembroke[488] out of the world, but that Mr.
 Middleton who opened him says that both heart and all the vitals
 were displaced by the continual swathing he used to keep himself
 from growing bulky. This was itself a discontented temper, and if
 at any time I should be extremely strait laced and contradicted,
 it is certain my crossness would have been very great, and I or
 my lace must burst. The giving Ward’s pill to a cock and then
 turning it into broth for old Lady Northampton[489] has something
 curious in it too, but as it ended in death, I suppose will not
 be practised further. How many tricks do we try to lengthen life,
 and yet like poor Lord Pembroke waste it in tormenting our blood
 because others will not be of our mind, or we are too fat, or
 too lean to please ourselves: if there is not another life where
 we may be more perfect, more happy, we are certainly the most
 inconsistent, foolish creatures this world produces; how much
 better the other planets have for inhabitants I know not.

    [487] From a letter of Mrs. Medows, 1744, Shaw belonged to the
    duchess, and had been rented by a Mr. Forster, who then went to
    live at Englefield.

    [488] Henry, 28th Earl of Pembroke, died January 9, 1750.

    [489] Elizabeth, second wife and widow of 11th Earl of Northampton.

[Page heading: THE EARTHQUAKE]

The earthquake mentioned by Horace Walpole in his letters to Sir Horace
Mann, page 349 in volume 2, on February 5, created much terror. The
Montagus were in Hill Street at the time. On February 20, in a letter
to her sister, Mrs. Montagu says--

 “I was not under any apprehensions about the earthquake, but went
 that night to the Oratorio, then quietly to bed, but the madness of
 the multitude was prodigious, near 50 of the people I had sent to,
 to play at cards here the Saturday following, went out of town to
 avoid being swallowed, and I believe they made a third part of the
 number I asked, so that you may imagine how universal the fright
 must be. The Wednesday night the Oratorio was very empty, though it
 was the most favourite performance of Handel’s.”

A slighter shock took place a month later; some people prognosticated a
worse shock on April 3, which was to swallow up London. The following
letter of the Duchess of Chandos alludes to this:--

  “Shaw, April 3.

  “DEAR MADAM,

 “I do assure you although I had many accounts of the earthquake, I
 do easily perceive the difference betwixt a fright, and a sensible
 account of the same matter of fact: the day this, I hope, will
 kiss your hands and find perfect peace and safety at Hill Street,
 is the day when in many people have great fears, but in my opinion
 without reason, for I never heard of periodical earthquakes, and
 the coolness of the weather I hope will assuage these sulphurous
 heats. It would now bear hard upon Human understanding as well as
 gratitude, if when they see how very easily the destruction of
 popular places may be effected, we should not all live in such a
 way as to make Death not so extremely shocking to us, as it has
 appeared to some of the gay world at this time. The same Providence
 that certainly made this complicated and beautiful Machine, is not
 the children that blow bubbles in air only to divert themselves,
 but has will, and good further designs suitable to His infinite
 goodness and wisdom, and therefore a hope in Him is a real security
 in all evils, and as to the manner of Death I have it, may be a
 peculiar thought, that there is a degree of pain that human nature
 cannot exceed consistent with life; which is a great mercy, or else
 our cruelty to one another would be without bounds: therefore I
 will never be too anxious what is the manner of my death, but trust
 it to that power that sent me into life....

  “Dear Madam, yʳ much obliged
  and faithful humble servant,
  “L. C. CHANDOS.”

[Page heading: DEATH OF DR. CONYERS MIDDLETON]

There are few letters for 1750 in my collection. In July Mrs. Montagu
went to Tunbridge Wells, whilst Mr. Montagu prepared to accept the
invitation of his Huntingdon constituents to the races, etc., held
there. Miss Anstey, who had accompanied Lady Romney[490] to Tunbridge,
remained with Mrs. Montagu for a while. Dr. Conyers Middleton and his
wife not being in good health, went to London to consult physicians.
In June, from Horace Walpole’s letters to George Montagu we learn the
doctor was suffering from jaundice and dropsy, and was much broken in
health. He died on July 28, 1750. In a letter of Mr. Montagu’s, dated
August 4, from London, he says--

 “This morning at Vaillante’s the bookseller, I met Dr. Green,[491]
 the Regius Professor, who told me the Friday before his death
 Dr. Middleton sent for Dr. Plumtree, told him he thought he had
 but a very short time to live, desired him freely to tell him his
 opinion, which from the knowledge he had of him, he hoped he would
 make no scruple to do, upon which the Professor told him he thought
 he could live but a few hours; then he asked the Professor if from
 his pulse he thought his death would be easy, who answered that he
 did. He further told the Professor he had taken Dr. Heberden’s[492]
 medicines till he found they did him no good, his case being out
 of the Power of Physick. Dr. Green said he had left his niece an
 annuity, but did not say what, nor any further about his will. He
 was buried at St. Michael’s, Cambridge.”

    [490] _Née_ Priscilla Pym, wife of 2nd Baron Romney.

    [491] Dr. John Green, born 1706, died 1779; afterwards Bishop of
    Lincoln.

    [492] Dr. William Heberden, born 1710, died 1801; physician and
    author.

Mrs. Montagu mourned sincerely for one who had acted as a grandfather,
a godfather, and an instructor to her.

[Page heading: ANNIVERSARY OF WEDDING-DAY]

Of a splendid letter she wrote to Mr. Montagu on the return of the
anniversary of her wedding-day, August 5, only a few sentences can be
inserted from its length.

  “MY DEAREST,

 “There is not any day in which you have not a right to my most
 grateful acknowledgments, but there is not any day that so
 particularly demands them as the fifth of August, when you made me
 your friend and companion, and gave me so near an alliance to your
 virtues and fortune, all so superior to what I could expect. I can
 truly assure you my affection and esteem for you, and happiness in
 you have increased every day. I am not sensible there can be any
 further progress or addition made, but as I owe every happiness
 to you, each day’s felicity adds to my obligation, and I hope
 you think what does so increase my gratitude for eight years’
 happiness in a state so often wretched, inexpressible thanks are
 due. May we enjoy many years together of this happy society, but
 if I should be taken from you, let the consciousness of having
 been the occasion of my enjoying more happiness in a short life
 than is the lot of thousands in a long one, take out the sting of
 grief, and teach you to think of me with a tender but not painful
 remembrance....” She signs--

  “With heart and hand your grateful,
  affectionate, faithful and obedient Wife,
  “E. MONTAGU.”

[Page heading: MRS. BOSCAWEN]

At Tunbridge this year Mrs. Montagu first became acquainted with Mrs.
Boscawen, wife of Admiral Boscawen; she describes her as “a very
sensible, lively, ingenious woman, and she seems to have good moral
qualities. We often pass the evening together, partly in conversation,
partly in reading.” Mrs. Boscawen’s maiden name was Frances Glanville;
she had married Edward Boscawen, second son of 1st Viscount Falmouth,
in 1742. As Dorothy Boscawen, aunt to the Admiral, married Sir Philip
Medows, the families were already connected.

Mrs. Medows writes to Mrs. Montagu, “I think of Mrs. Boscawen as you
do, I expect you should be fond of the Admiral,[493] his cool courage,
his firmness, good nature, diligence and regularity, with his strong
sense and good head, make a great character.”

    [493] Admiral the Hon. Edward Boscawen, born 1711, died 1761.

[Page heading: MR. GILBERT WEST]

Sir Dudley and Lady Ryder, Lady Townsend, and Lady Robinson, wife of
“Short” Sir Thomas Robinson,[494] were amongst the company. A Mr.
Samuel Torriano also appears as a friend of Mrs. Montagu’s. He tries
to find her a cottage near London, as she fancies her health would be
better in the country, and yet not so far from London as Sandleford,
during the winter session when Mr. Montagu would have to be in London.
The reception rooms in Hill Street were to be decorated in the early
spring. Hearing of a cottage at West Wickham, near Croydon, Mrs.
Montagu went to see it, and made her first acquaintance with Mr.
Gilbert West.[495] He was the son of the Rev. Dr. Richard West by
Maria, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, of Stowe. He married in 1729
Catherine Bartlett, by whom he had an only son, Richard. With them
lived Miss Maria West,[496] his sister; his mother had remarried Lord
John Langham. West was a cousin of Mr. Botham’s, also of Mr. Lyttelton,
afterwards Sir George Lyttelton. Writing to Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Montagu
says--

 “I saw at Wickham the miracle of the Moral World, a Christian Poet,
 an humble philosopher, a great genius, without contempt of those
 who have none.... I am charmed with Mrs. West, and approve all you
 say of her. She is neither a tenth muse, nor a fourth grace, but
 she is better than all put together. I believe it might truly be
 said of her--

    “‘That she always speaks her thought,
    And always thinks the very thing she ought.’

 Her vivacity, easiness of behaviour and good sense delight me.

 “Mr. West has been so good as to find out a cottage for me.
 The pleasure of being near Mr. West gets the better of all
 considerations in regard to the situation of my cottage. I hope it
 will be an inducement to you to visit my hermitage, where you shall
 be entertained with the wholesome fare of brown bread, sincerity
 and red cow’s milk, which afford good nourishment to the mind and
 body.”

    [494] Afterwards Lord Grantham.

    [495] Born 1706, died April, 1756. Author and poet; translator of
    Odes of Pindar, etc.

    [496] Maria West, afterwards wife of 1st Viscount Bridport.

[Page heading: BARRY AND GARRICK]

On October 16 she writes, “The cruel owner of the house near Mr. West
makes unreasonable demands, we are going to treat for one about two
miles from him, which Mrs. West and he went with me to see yesterday.”
She laments it is so far from the Wests. This house was at Hayes in
Kent, or, as it is frequently spelt in the letters, “Heyes.” Mrs.
Montagu continues--

 “I hear there is a great strife and contention between Mr.
 Barry[497] and Garrick, each acting the part of Romeo[498] every
 night, and that the ladies think the first makes the best lover,
 by which one may learn they think beauty a better qualification
 than sense in that character, for Barry always seems to betray the
 fool in all the parts he appears in.... The Duke of Ancaster[499]
 is going to take unto wife the daughter of Mr. Panton;[500] the
 match is at last agreed upon, and coaches and jewels and horses and
 servants and houses and clothes and all the fine things with which
 Hymen now embroiders his saffron robe, are bespoken....

 “Mr. Ramsay[501] was so good as to call on us, and Mr. Montagu
 and I went to his house, where we had the pleasure to see some
 admirable pictures.”

    [497] Spranger Barry, born 1719, died 1777; celebrated Irish actor.

    [498] Barry at Covent Garden, and Garrick at Drury Lane.

    [499] Peregrine, 3rd Duke of Ancaster.

    [500] Mr. Panton was Master of the King’s Racers.

    [501] Allan Ramsay, born 1709, died 1784. Eminent portrait painter;
 son of the poet.

These letters are addressed to Hatchlands, Admiral Boscawen’s place
near Guildford.

[Page heading: EMBROIDERED FLOUNCES]

In a letter to Sarah at this period, Mrs. Montagu mentioned the
appointment of her brother Robert to a Madras and China voyage: “I
rejoice in the Captain’s appointed voyage to Madras and China, it is
reckoned a profitable and healthful voyage, and all we ask for our King
is ‘in health and wealth long to live.’” She then proceeds to comment
on some white satin flounces Sarah wished embroidered in China.

 “As you design them to be in white, they need only have the outline
 drawn on one flounce and on the sleeves and robing. Mrs. Marsh
 is the best contriver of flounces: she did me a white lutestring
 very prettily, this summer’s gown is to be cut in the same manner,
 but not pinked.... All people are buying cloaths for the Birthday
 ... the prices are most unreasonable, 17 and 18 shillings a yard
 for Damask, and six and twenty for flowered silks of an ordinary
 appearance.”

In November Sarah Robinson writes to her sister as to her lover’s
appointment at Court--

 “Mr. Scott[502] is appointed to have the education of Prince
 George.[503] I can’t give this employment any name, for none but
 the King has a right to appoint any one over the young Princes
 under the title of governor or Preceptor; the salary I cannot tell
 you, it being not yet determined. His Royal Highness[504] has left
 it to Mr. Scott’s friends to name whatever they think proper, and
 has behaved in the handsomest manner imaginable. He was recommended
 to the Prince for this place by a great number of people, many of
 whom had very little personal----” (the end of the letter is lost).

    [502] He was made sub-preceptor.

    [503] George III., then twelve years old.

    [504] Frederick, Prince of Wales, father of Prince George.

[Page heading: THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF CHANDOS]

Probably the Duchess of Portland may have been one, as she sided with
Sarah in the affair, telling Mrs. Montagu that she might wish to obey
her in all other respects, but could not control her affections. Lord
Bolingbroke is said to have recommended him through Lord Bathurst. The
ill-starred marriage took place probably at the commencement of 1751,
but no letters are left recording it. On November 18 the Dowager
Duchess of Chandos died at Shaw House, near Newbury, and in a letter to
Miss Anstey is thus noticed--

 “A little before I went to London I lost my very good neighbour,
 the Duchess of Chandos, a stroke of the palsy carried her off in
 a few days: her bodily pains were great, but her mind felt the
 serenity that gilds the evening of a virtuous life. She quitted
 the world with that decent fare-well which people take of it, who
 rather consider it as a place in which they are to impart good
 than to enjoy it. Her character has made a great impression on me,
 as I think her a rare instance that age could not make conceited
 and stiff, nor retirement discontented, nor virtue inflexible and
 severe.”

To Mrs. Donnellan, on December 30, Mrs. Montagu says, “The Duchess of
Chandos is greatly missed by the poor this rigorous season.”

In these two letters the following books and pamphlets are recommended,
“An Occasional Letter,” said to be Lord Bolingbroke’s;[505] the King
of Prussia’s “Memoires pour servir à L’Histoire de la Maison de
Brandenbourg,” and “Sully’s Memoires.”

    [505] Viscount Bolingbroke, born 1678, died 1751; philosopher and
 statesman.


[Year: 1751]

January, 1751, finds Mrs. Montagu in London, and Mr. Montagu at
Sandleford Priory, engaged in business affairs. Mrs. Montagu, on
January 7, writes to him--

  “MY DEAREST,

 “I am glad you are so far tired of your monastic life as to think
 of returning to the secular state of a husband and a member of
 Parliament. I believe our predecessors in the cowl had their
 particular kinds of _volupté_ which silence, secresy and peace
 might much enhance and recommend; but to those who have been used
 to the bustle and business of life such pleasures want vivacity.
 Boileau makes a man who goes to visit the Chantre just before
 dinner observe the luxury of a prebendal table. Says he--

    “‘Il voit la nappe mise,
    Admire le bel ordre, et reconnait l’_Eglise_.’

 I have sat so constantly in Lady Sandwich’s chimney corner, I can
 give you little account of the world.”

To which Mr. Montagu rejoins, “I am much obliged to you for the kind
impatience you show at my stay here; in a few days I now hope to
convince you that however unworthy of either state, I have deserted
neither.” He was accompanied to London by Captain Robinson.

From a letter of Mr. Gilbert West’s of May 16, 1751, we learn that Mrs.
Montagu, though wishing to be near London and yet not in it, did not
take up her temporary residence at Hayes till then. In it he says, “I
have agreed with a farmer at Wickham to fetch your goods at the price
of 15 shillings: the waggon will be in Hill Street to-morrow morning
early.” He desires her to breakfast and dine at West Wickham with him,
and signs himself, “Dear Madam, your loving cousin to command till
death, G. W.”

[Page heading: “THE COUSINHOOD”]

In the collection of letters published by her nephew, Matthew Robinson,
4th Baron Rokeby, he says he cannot remember the reason why West and
Mrs. Montagu called each other cousins, but he had forgotten his
cousinship to the Bothams, the beloved cousins of his aunt, Mrs.
Montagu. “The cousinhood” was also the favourite term of the whole set
of Wests, Pitts, and Lytteltons, all much connected in marriage and
extreme intimacy.

Gilbert West was at this period forty-five years of age only, but even
then a perfect martyr to gout. Amongst his poems and translations was
Lucian’s “Triumph of the Gout,” every line of which he could painfully
indorse. In his “Lives of the Poets” Dr. Johnson[506] brackets him
with Crashaw under “the two venerable names of _Poet and Saint_.” He
was often visited by Lyttelton and Pitt, “who, when they were weary of
faction and debates, used at Wickham to find books and quiet, a decent
table and literary conversation.”

    [506] _Vide_ Johnson’s “Lives of the Poets.”

There may still be seen at Wickham a walk made by Pitt, and at Wickham,
Lyttelton received that conviction which produced his “Dissertation on
Saint Paul.” The same spirit of _cheerful_ and _benign religion_ was
now to exercise a large influence on Elizabeth Montagu, to strengthen
her already religious turn of mind, and to enable her in the future,
though living in the great world of fashion and rank, and the idol of
society, to keep that sacred, secret lamp of spirituality _not of this
world_ alight.

[Page heading: THE WEST FAMILY]

The family circle at the Wests was a happy one; his wife and sister
adored him, and he was the magnet that attracted all to him. He had a
great sense of humour and a pretty taste for decorating, as the many
letters upon the subject of the adornment of the Hill Street rooms
show; Mrs. Montagu took his advice in every point from this time till
his death in 1756. At the period I am now writing of he was far from
well off, though expecting promotion, with just reason, having been a
faithful servant to the King, and secretary to Lord Townshend during
his period of office as Secretary of State.

[Page heading: MR. R. BERANGER]

Amongst the friends of the Wests, Mrs. Montagu now made acquaintance
with Mr. R. Berenger,[507] called by Mrs. West “the little Marquis.”
He was the son of Moses Beranger and Penelope Temple, and was therefore
related on the maternal side to West. He afterwards became “Gentleman
of the Horse” to George III. He wrote a book called the “History and
Art of Horsemanship.” He was famous for his charm in social life.
Hannah More called him “everybody’s favourite, all chivalry, blank
verse and anecdote,” and Dr. Johnson dubbed him “the Standard of
true Elegance.” He was a great friend of the Garricks. Another fresh
acquaintance was William Henry Lyttelton, brother of Sir George
(afterwards Lord) Westcote.

    [507] R. Berenger, born 1720, died 1782.

At some early period of this year Sarah Robinson became the wife of
George Lewis Scott, but no date is recorded, and no letters concerning
the marriage remain. Only on June 9, when Mrs. Montagu was making her
yearly visit to Tunbridge Wells in company with Lady Romney, she writes
to her husband at Sandleford to say she had arrived safely, “Mrs. Scott
and the Captain,” whose departure to China had been delayed, seeing
her off. From other letters it appears the Scotts, accompanied by Lady
Barbara Montagu, took up their abode in Leicester Fields, now Leicester
Square, doubtless to be close to Leicester House, where, with their
mother, the widowed Princess of Wales,[508] Scott’s royal pupils dwelt.

    [508] Frederick, Prince of Wales, died March 31, 1751.

At Tunbridge Mrs. Montagu joined Mr. and Mrs. West and their son, and
lodged in the same house. At Tunbridge were Sir George Lyttelton, his
brother the Dean, the famous Mr. Garrick, the Bishop of London, etc.
Then she wrote--

 “Monsieur[509] and Madame Mirepoix are come to pass a few days
 here, but I imagine they will soon be tired of us. The Justices of
 Peace have done great service to the imprudent part of our company
 by prohibiting gaming, and though you may suppose I do not number
 myself among them, I feel my obligations to them on account of the
 servants, who have one temptation less to be idle and bad.”

    [509] The French ambassador and his wife. She was a daughter of the
 Princesse de Craon.

She then adds grateful words to her husband, who had written to say
he had made a fresh will, and in her favour. Mr. Montagu was then in
London, but on the eve of going north to attend to his own estates
in Yorkshire, and the complicated business of regulating Mr. Rogers’
affairs in Northumberland. In this letter he says--

 “I this day, though I could ill spare the time, dined in Leicester
 Fields” (with the Scotts). “Being in the city I was informed by Dr.
 Middleton’s bookseller that Mrs. Middleton has had the good luck
 to sell Hildersham for 2000 guineas, it cost the Doctor, he said,
 £1600, besides what he lay’d out in building, so that if there
 should be some loss it cannot be much.”

[Page heading: HILDERSHAM]

Hildersham was some miles from Cambridge. Here Gray, the poet, loved
to visit Conyers Middleton, and improved his friendship with William
Robinson, who was preparing for Holy Orders, and whom Gray always
called the “Reverend Billy.”

On July 23 Mr. Montagu writes from Huntingdon--

 “I lay last night at Cambridge. I dined with Mrs. Middleton in
 company with your brother, and the evening I spent with the Master
 of Clare Hall. Mrs. Middleton indulged me with the sight of some
 letters that passed between the Doctor and a great man[510] who
 formerly had a seat not far from Cambridge, and who is no more....
 She very obligingly of herself promised your brother all the
 Doctor’s Sermons which she had in her custody, and promised also to
 keep it secret, which I think you and I should also do, even from
 the brotherhood.... The races are to continue 4 days....

 “I desire when wheatears are plenty and you send any to your
 friends in London, you would send some to Monsieur de Moivre at
 Pons Coffee House in Cecil Court in St. Martin’s Lane, for I think
 he longs to taste them.”

    [510] Probably the 1st Earl of Godolphin, who lived at Gog Magog,
 near Cambridge.

[Page heading: MISS MARIA NAYLOR]

Mrs. Montagu wishing to hear about the Huntingdon races, he says--

 “I can tell you little about the races, having no concern in the
 bets, but I heard Lord Trentham had lost £1000, Captain William
 Montagu £200. Lord Sandwich’s horse won a heat, but he did not tell
 me how much he won.

 “At the ball all the family of the Naylors were there, with Captain
 William Montagu’s lady, who danced country dances. Miss Maria
 Naylor danced both kind of dances, and was, I think, the lady that
 outshone all the rest. Her head dress was new and particular, and
 became her very well, and gave her the air of a shepherdess....
 There was Mrs. Apreece and Mrs. Alstone, who married my relation
 with a fortune of £4000, and Miss Ascham, etc. The distinguished
 amongst the men besides the Prince of Baden, and the Marquis de
 Bellegarde, were the Duke of Kingston,[511] Lord Montfort,[512]
 Lord Onslow,[513] Lord Goring,[514] Lord March,[515] Lord
 Eggletone,[516] Mr. Alstone and Mr. Apreece. The members both of
 the county and town. Mr. Wortley from the Huntingdon races set out
 for those of Reading.”

    [511] The 2nd Duke.

    [512] 1st Baron Montfort, of Horseheath.

    [513] 3rd Baron Onslow.

    [514] Viscount Goring, a Jacobite Viscount.

    [515] 3rd Earl of March, afterwards Duke of Queensberry. “Old Q.”

    [516] 10th Earl of Eglintown.

This was young Edward Wortley Montagu.

Mrs. Montagu writes to say her father had arrived at Tunbridge in great
spirits with a party of five, and she was, she adds, much better.

 “I have a great appetite. I think I shall be able to eat for a
 wager, with my brother-in-law.[517] I am glad Miss Maria Naylor
 had an opportunity of shining in her proper sphere, the county of
 Huntingdon. Why should the Gunnings[518] of universal empire drive
 her from her little native land? Do they want to add the epithet
 of great to their names? Indeed I do not know why Gunning the
 great should not sound as well as Alexander the Great. I am afraid
 the eldest Miss Naylor is much dejected at the infidelity of our
 cousin Wortley, who is greatly enamoured of little Miss Ashe. All
 collectors of natural curiosities love something of every species.
 Mr. Wortley has had a passion for all sorts and sizes of women.
 Miss Ashe is a sort of middle species between a woman and a fairy,
 and by her rarity worthy to be added even to so large a collection
 of amours.”

    [517] George Lewis Scott.

    [518] The celebrated Irish beauties, afterwards one Countess of
    Coventry, the other Duchess of Hamilton and Argyll.

[Page heading: MISS ASHE]

Miss Ashe, or the “Pollard Ashe,” as Walpole called her, eloped with
Edward Wortley Montagu in the autumn of 1751. He was soon after this
put in prison with a Mr. Taafe in France for robbing or cheating a Jew.
As he was married before, though separated from his wife, he could not
marry Miss Ashe. She afterwards married a Mr. Falconer, R.N.

It was in this year Horace Walpole had written to Sir Horace Mann--

 “Our greatest miracle is Lady Mary Wortley’s son whose adventures
 have made so much noise, his parts are not proportionate, but his
 expense is incredible. His father scarce allows him anything, yet
 he plays, dresses, diamonds himself, even to distinct shoe buckles
 for a frock, and has more snuff-boxes than would suffice a Chinese
 idol with an hundred noses. But the most curious part of his dress,
 which he has brought from Paris, is an iron wig; you literally
 would not know it from hair. I believe it is on this account that
 the Royal Society have just chosen him of their body.”

Mrs. Montagu wrote the description of “our cousin’s adventures,” and
after several comments on Wortley’s conduct, she says, “Poor Miss Ashe
weeps like the forsaken Ariadne on a foreign shore.”

The company at Tunbridge Wells had been increased by the Duke and
Duchess of Newcastle, the Duchess of Norfolk, and, Mrs. Montagu
writes, “we expect those goddesses called the Gunnings and Sir Thomas
Robinson.... My Father is very gay, but complains he never saw the
place so dull. I never said so to those about me, lest they should say
to me as Swift to the fat man who complained of a crowd, ‘Friend, you
make the very crowd you blame!’ Mr. West reads to us in the evening,
and the wit of the last age supplies us when we do not meet with any in
this.”

[Page heading: DEATH OF MRS. PERCIVAL]

[Page heading: DR. SHAW]

At this period Mrs. Percival (Anne Donnellan’s mother) died; she had
long been in bad health. Dr. Shaw, the celebrated traveller, died also,
and Mrs. Montagu comments thus on August 29 on the two events to her
husband, who was then at Newcastle--

 “As to poor Mrs. Percival I hailed her voyage to the realms of
 rest: the last page of life is commonly a blank. But for poor
 Shaw,[519] he might have lived and laughed and talked of the Deluge
 and collected cockle shells many years longer. The death of those
 we esteem afflicts us; we are shocked at the death of those we have
 laughed[520] at and laughed with, as we never looked upon them in
 so serious a light as to suppose so sad an event could happen to
 them. I would deck his tomb with emblems of all the wonders of the
 land and deep; crocodiles should weep and tigers howl; every shell
 should become vocal; sea-weed should bloom immortal on his tomb,
 and moss, though petrified, lie lightly on his breast. What signify
 voyages? What signifies learning! Hebrew Professor! Traveller to
 Memphis! Sole witness living of the present state of the Ptolemies!
 Must all these glories sink into oblivion? How gloriously had he
 been interred had he died in the perilous pass of the Pyramids,
 and succeeded Mark Anthony in the bed of Cleopatra! I hope the
 poor man will have the satisfaction of being embalmed in the true
 Egyptian manner, for the more like a mummy his body be made, the
 more it will joy his gentle ghost. Nature has lost the inventory of
 all works in losing Shaw, for he knew every plant from the Hyssop
 to the Cedar of Lebanon, and every animal from the pismire to the
 whale. I am afraid his sister Sarah must again dust down those
 cobwebs she has been taught to venerate, and kill the moths in a
 stuff turban, though it should have a horn more or a horn less.”

    [519] Dr. Thomas Shaw; traveller, antiquary, and naturalist.

    [520] In former letters his merry and loud laughter in the
    Bullstrode circle is commented on.

Another Dr. Shaw is frequently mentioned as a chief physician at
Tunbridge Wells, but whether he was a relation of the archæologian and
naturalist, I have not been able to ascertain.

In a letter from Newcastle of September 1, Mr. Montagu, who with
his steward, Mr. Carter, was regulating the business of his cousin,
Mr. Rogers, mentions Denton Hall[521] for the first time, which was
eventually to become one of his residences.

    [521] Note at the end of this work on Denton Hall.

 “Yesterday Mr. Carter and I rid to Denton, which is about 3 miles
 from Newcastle. We first viewed the house which is a good deal
 worse than I thought, and indeed so bad that it would not be
 justifiable to lay out any money upon it. The rooms on the second
 floor are pretty good, and served the family when they went there,
 but if ever I should be so happy as to have your company in these
 parts, if these should be thought fit I would hope it would be no
 difficult matter to find you some better accommodation. This next
 week I propose to go to a Farm of Mr. R.’s at Jarrow, about ten
 miles from Newcastle, and to Monk Seaton, where he has another. I
 never have yet been at either of them.”

[Page heading: JARROW]

Amongst his other property Mr. Rogers owned much in coal mines, some of
them entirely his own, others in which, with the Claverings, Mr. Bowes,
the Bishop of Durham, etc., he owned a share. Mr. Montagu was employing
a Mr. Newton to value these--a complicated, unfair business. Owing to
Mr. Rogers’ lunacy, much advantage had been taken by dishonest stewards
and coal merchants, too long and complicated for description in these
pages. On September 8 Mr. Montagu writes--

 “On Friday last I was at a farm one half whereof belongs to Mr.
 Rogers, the other to Sir Thomas Clavering, called Jarrow, not
 far from Tynemouth, it is in the parish where the Venerable
 Bede formerly practised. Upon a Key this estate is obliged to
 contribute to for the repair of all the Ships that come to this
 port, they unload their ballast, which in length of time is become
 an incredible heap. This estate is let at £107 10_s._ per ann.
 To-morrow we go to Ravensworth, after which, when we shall have
 visited Seaton and Rudchester, we shall have seen all Mr. R.’s
 territories.”

[Page heading: CARLISLE TURNPIKE ROAD]

In the next letter he says--

 “North Seaton lies upon the sea, consists of very good land with
 coal under, and has a key and a granary for corn and some quarrys
 of stone. The other estate of Rudchester is that through which
 the Carlisle Road is to pass, and which with all the clamour of
 the tenants will, as we think, be rather a benefit than hurt to
 the estate. It is thought to have a good deal of good coal in it,
 and but a very little way from the river Tyne, and will be very
 valuable if ever the river should be made navigable so high up as
 Mr. Carter thinks it may be in twenty years’ time.”

Mr. Montagu also adds that he and Mr. Carter have discovered that Mr.
Rogers owned two-thirds of a colliery at West Denton, of which they had
not known.

On September 13 a son was born to the Dauphin[522] of France, and Mrs.
Montagu writes on the 15th--

    [522] Louis, Duke of Burgundy, son of the Dauphin.

 “I hear Monsieur Mirepoix intends the town fine illuminations and
 masquerades on the birth of the Dauphin. I believe every miserable
 peasant in France has great joy in the birth of one who is to be
 his future tyrant. Strange infatuation!... I wish the English loved
 their Island as well as the French do their ‘Monarque.’”[523]

    [523] Louis XV.

On the 22nd Mrs. Montagu writes to say she is packing up for London,
and she begs her husband, who is thinking of moving southward, not
to travel with a single servant, as “every newspaper is filled with
accounts of robbery.” She congratulates him “on having so well
considered and settled Mr. Rogers’ affairs. It appears a noble estate,
and I hope to see it in your possession who would nobly enjoy it.”

Matthew Robinson had been in Yorkshire, and thence travelled to
Scotland, then little visited. Mrs. Montagu says--

 “I suppose my brother Robinson is by this time returning to the
 known world. I expect to hear he has travelled to the extremity
 of Scotland, for he is a man of infinite curiosity, and would have
 knowledge at no entrance quite shut out.”

To this her husband rejoins, “Whenever I come near London I will hire a
guard, and if I can give you sufficient notice shall not be sorry to be
met by Brunton....” He says he has not heard of Brother Robinson since
he dined with him. “If he has gone to Scotland, I have lately read in
a book concerning the Rebellion, that barbarous part of our island may
in good weather be seen with pleasure!” In return, his wife writes from
London that she is going to Hayes “to enjoy quiet and my books till
you arrive. I take Mrs. Isted with me.” Mrs. Isted was a poor lady who
acted as housekeeper to Mrs. Montagu, and had seen better days.

The Scotts had been dining with her. They were then living at Chelsea,
as London did not suit Sarah’s delicate health. A scheme of education
for the young princes had been drawn up and submitted to the King, who
was much pleased with it. It was also rumoured he was to take them to
Hanover next year, “a step which will not be popular.”

[Page heading: DR. MIDDLETON’S WORKS]

 “Dr. Middleton’s works are to be printed by the booksellers by
 subscription. Mrs. Middleton sold the copies for £300: it seems to
 me an insolence in the booksellers that should not be encouraged.
 I should never grudge the guinea I could spare to a man of genius,
 but to a set of wretches that live by other people’s wits, I am not
 so willing to part with that gold which the wise man allows to be
 better than anything except wisdom. It is strange malice in Apollo
 to make poor authors and rich booksellers, he should give his upper
 servants the best wages.”

From Hayes, on September 30, she writes--

 “I am so well in health that I scarce know myself, and I think I
 am a little like the humorous Lieutenant that would run no hazards
 when he was well, though he was prodigal of life when he had a pain
 in his side. I am very desirous to preserve this comfortable state
 of health, and also my comely, plump and jolly condition; my face
 is no longer a _memento mori_. I am like one of the goddess Hebe’s
 elder sisters, ‘Not ever fair and young, but not so wan and decayed
 as of late.’” She adds, “Lady Bab and my sister design to visit my
 solitude in a few days. She is much better for country air, but
 they do not enjoy many rural pleasures at Chelsea, it is too near
 London.”

[Page heading: MRS. DONNELLAN]

[Page heading: JOURNEY TO IRELAND]

Mrs. Donnellan, having let her house to Lord Holderness, was preparing
to go to Ireland to visit Dr. and Mrs. Delany at Delville, and her
relations. She was staying with her friends the Southwells, at King’s
Weston, and as her letters throw light on the then mode of travelling,
I insert portions--

  “Delville, near Dublin, October 7.

  “MY DEAR MRS. MONTAGU,

 “I am sure will be pleased to hear I am got safe to the end of my
 journeys and voyage, and am with my good friend Mrs. Delany resting
 myself after a good deal of fatigue. I left London as I told you
 I should, as I informed you by a letter from King’s Weston, which
 I hope you got. Mr. Leslie, the gentleman who took the charge of
 conducting me to Ireland, came at the time appointed, but we heard
 so bad an account of the cross roads between Bristol and Chester
 that we were very near setting out again for London, and going
 from thence to Chester. However, I plucked up courage, and as my
 good friends would do everything to accommodate me, we set out on
 Thursday sen’night with Mr. Southwell’s coach, two post-chaises and
 Mr. Southwell’s groom and double horse,[524] so that we had variety
 enough. The road for the greatest part to Gloucester was so bad I
 rid most of it, but hearing it would rather mend I sent back the
 coach, and between the chaise and the horse got to Chester and on
 to Park Gate in five days, and Mr. Leslie my companion, being a
 very sensible, polite travelled man, made the journey as agreeable
 as such a journey could be. We found Lord and Lady Fitzwilliams and
 many more waiting at Park Gate for the King’s Yacht, but as I hate
 a crowded ship and am not a coward, I resolved not to wait, and
 the wind being fair, we hired a small ship for ten guineas and set
 sail. The next morning at six o’clock and with the finest weather
 imaginable made our passage and landed in Dublin in 30 hours. The
 Bishop of Clogher, who had been enquiring for me the morning tide,
 came to the house when I was landed, with his usual politeness, and
 carried me to their house, and as it was too late to come here,
 they kept me that night, and the next day Mrs. Delany came and
 brought me here, where I am extremely happy, the most polite and
 hearty welcome, a large and convenient house, sweet gardens and a
 manner of living quite to my sober taste. Our only disturbance are
 visitors: we had yesterday seven coaches and six, mostly my own
 relations, my brother, sister, nephews and nieces.”

    [524] Means a horse trained to carry a pillion.

[Page heading: THE DAUPHIN]

On October 31 there is a letter dated from London to Mr. Gilbert
West. In this Mrs. Montagu is forwarding him patterns of all kinds
of dove-coloured paper from Mr. Bromedge’s shop, and Mr. Linnell was
sending a marble chimney-piece for West’s big room at Wickham. She
says--

 “Poor Dr. Courayer notified to me that he was ill of a sore throat,
 and could not come to visit me, though he wanted to see me. I went
 to him, I was obliged to pass through all the gay vanities of Mrs.
 Chenevix,[525] and then ascend a most steep and difficult staircase
 to get at the little Philosopher: this way to wisdom through
 the vanities and splendid toys of the world might be prettily
 allegorized by the pen of the great Bunyan; the good man himself
 to an emblematizeing genius would have afforded an ample subject;
 his head was _enfoncé_ in a cap of the warmest beaver, made still
 more respectable by a gold orrace, ‘a wondrous hieroglyphick robe
 he wore,’ in which was portrayed all the attributes of the god
 Fo, with the arms and delineaments of the Cham of Tartary.... I
 began to consider him as the best piece of Chinese furniture I had
 ever seen, and could hardly forbear offering him a place on my
 chimney-piece. He asked much after your health.... There has been
 a terrible fracas in the court of the grand Monarque, the people,
 generally credulous, have strangely taken it into their heads that
 the Duke of Burgundy is not legitimate, and instead of acclamations
 and huzzas, murmurs and sighs have echo’d through the streets, on
 the days the feasts were made for the birth of this child; besides
 this there was conveyed into the cradle some gunpowder and a match
 with an epigram expressing that they would serve to blow up the
 pretended Duke of Burgundy. Upon his Majesty hearing this, the
 gouvernante, sub-gouvernante, women of the bedchamber, even to the
 toothless pap tasters, were all sent to the Bastille, one of the
 women who said she saw a hand reach over a screen to throw a paper
 into the cradle is since dead. A little knowledge is allowed to be
 a dangerous thing; had the lady been able to inform his Majesty at
 once who threw the paper, she had been safe, but it is supposed the
 hand that threw it, lest she should discover more, gave her a dose
 that has silenced her for ever....

 “The Duke and Duchess of Portland and Lord Titchfield dined with us
 to-day, and staid till eight o’clock; her grace inquired after you.”

    [525] Famous shop for _bric-à-brac_ and toys.

[Page heading: MR. NATHANIEL HOOKE]

The last letter of the year is on December 17, to Mr. West, from
Sandleford. From this it appears Mrs. Montagu was extremely unwell,
but anxious for the health of Mr. West, who had had one of his
periodical gout attacks, which had rendered his hands temporarily
incapable of use. In this mention of Mr. Hooke is made. Mr. Nathaniel
Hooke[526] wrote a “History of Rome,” and other works. He assisted
the old Duchess of Marlborough to write her “Memoirs of her Life,”
for which she gave him £5000. He was a Roman Catholic, a disciple of
Fenelon’s, and brought a Catholic priest to Pope on his death-bed.
“Pray have you made a good Protestant of Mr. Hooke? If you cure heresy
and schism, should you not have your doctor’s degree in divinity rather
than law?”

    [526] Died in 1763.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
