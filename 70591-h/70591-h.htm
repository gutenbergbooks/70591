<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> my early youth I heartily desired to know more
of the life of my great-great-aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth
Montagu. Every scrap of information I could pick
up respecting her I accumulated; therefore when my
cousins, Mrs. Wellesley and her sister, Miss Montagu,
in October, 1899, gave me the whole of her manuscripts
contained in 68 cases, holding from 100 to 150 letters
in each, my joy was unbounded!</p>

<p>In 1810 my grandfather, the 4th Baron Rokeby (her
nephew and adopted son), published two volumes
of her letters; these were followed by two more
volumes in 1813. To enable him to perform this
pleasing task he asked all her principal friends to return
her letters to him, beginning with the Dowager
Marchioness of Bath,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1">[1]</a> daughter of the Duchess of
Portland, who gave him back the earliest letters to her
mother, many carefully inserted in a curious grey paper
book by the duchess, who placed the date of reception
on each, and evidently valued them exceedingly. The
Rev. Montagu Pennington returned her letters to his
aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, the learned translator of
Epictetus; Mrs. Freind those to her husband; and
many other people did the same. From General
Pulteney, at Lord Bath’s death, she had asked for and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
received her correspondence with Lord Bath, which
she carefully preserved. At the death of Lord Lyttelton,
the executors, at her request, returned her her letters;
those to Gilbert West and other correspondents were
returned in the same manner. Meanwhile she kept all
letters of her special friends, as well as notabilities, so
that one may deem the collection quite unique, though
doubtless many letters have disappeared, notably those
of Sir Joshua Reynolds, many of whose letters were
destroyed by an ignorant caretaker of Mrs. Montagu’s
house, Denton Hall, near Newcastle-on-Tyne. There
are none of Horace Walpole’s, from whom she must have
received some; and those from several other celebrities
she knew well are missing.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" title="Return to text.">[1]</a> <i>Née</i> Elizabeth Cavendish, born 1735, died 1825, ætat 91.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Owing to the enormous quantity of letters undated,
the sorting has been terribly difficult, and I spent one
entire winter in making up bundles and labelling each
year. My grandfather made a variety of mistakes as to
the dates of the letters. I hope I have atoned for some
of his deficiencies, though a few mistakes are probably
inevitable. He nearly blinded himself by working at
night, and my grandmother<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> had constantly to copy the
letters in a large round hand to enable him to make them
out. After my grandmother’s death he discontinued
arranging them, though they might have been continued
till 1800, the year of Mrs. Montagu’s death.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" title="Return to text.">[2]</a> <i>Née</i> Elizabeth Charlton.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the present volumes only her early life is
presented, interwoven with portions of her most intimate
friends’ letters to herself. Were the whole of
this vast correspondence printed, a large bookcase
could be filled with the volumes. In order to consult
the varied tastes of the general reader, I have endeavoured
to pick out the most interesting portions of
her letters, such as relate to customs, fashions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
dress, price of food, habits, but I have often groaned in
spirit at having to leave out much that was noble in
sentiment, or long comments upon contemporary books
and events. If life should be spared me, I hope to
be able to continue my narrative, for, like the ring
produced by a stone thrown on the water, her circle of
friends and acquaintances increased yearly, and not
only comprised her English friends and every person
of distinction in Great Britain, but also the most distinguished
foreigners of all nations, notably the French.
It has been asserted that Gilbert West was the first
person to influence Mrs. Montagu on religious points.
That his amiable Christianity may have strengthened
her religious opinions I do not deny, but I hope it will
be seen from this book that from her earliest days,
when at the height of her <i>joie de vivre</i>, the religious
sentiment was existent—a religion that prompted her
ever to the kindest actions to all classes, that had nothing
bitter or narrow in it, no dogmatism. Adored by men
of all opinions, and liking their society, she was the
purest of the pure, as is amply proved by the letters
of Lord Lyttelton, Dr. Monsey, and others, but she was
no prude with all this. Her worthy husband adored
her, and no wife could have been more devoted and
obedient than she was. His was a noble character, and
doubtless influenced her much for good. As a wife, a
friend, a <i>camarade</i> in all things, grave or gay, she was
unequalled; as a housewife she was notable, beloved
by her servants, by the poor of her parish, and by her
miners and their wives and children. She planned
feasts and dances and instituted schools for them, and
fed and clothed the destitute.</p>

<p>With Mr. Raikes<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3">[3]</a> she was one of the first people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
to institute Sunday-schools. She was as interested
in Betty’s rheumatism as she was in the conversation
of a duke or a duchess; a discussion with bishops and
Gilbert West on religion, or with Emerson on mathematics,
or Elizabeth Carter on Epictetus, all came alike
to her gifted nature. She danced with the gay, she
wept with the mourner; her sympathies never lay idle,
even to the very end of life; and in a century which
has been deemed by many to be coarse, uneducated,
and irreligious, her sweet wholesome nature shone like
a star, and attracted all minor lights. Where in the
twentieth century should we find a coterie of men and
women of the highest rank and influence in the world,
either from intellect or position, so content and devoted
to each other, so free from the petty jealousies and
sarcasms of the present fashionable society, so anxious
for each other’s welfare, socially and morally; so free
from cant or prudery, so devoted to each other’s
interest?</p>

<p>A great and terrible break in this book was caused
by the death of my beloved husband in May, 1904,
after a long, lingering illness. I doubt if I should
have taken courage to resume my pen if it had not
been for my friend Mr. A. M. Broadley, whose interest
in my literary work and affectionate solicitude for
myself has been a kindly spur to goad me on to action,
so as to complete the present volumes. To him I
tender my thanks for past and present encouragement,
as well as many other kindnesses.</p>

<span class="s6">GIRLHOOD UP TO 1738, AND BEGINNING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE
WITH THE DUCHESS OF PORTLAND.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROBINSON FAMILY</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering on the life of Elizabeth Robinson,
afterwards Mrs. Edward Montagu, the famous <i lang="fr">bas bleu</i>,
the focus, as she may be called, of all the cleverest and
most intellectual society of the last half of the eighteenth
century, a few words must be said of the family she
sprang from. The Robinsons are said to have been
originally Robertsons, the name being corrupted into
Robinson. They are in many Peerages<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4">[4]</a> said to descend
from the Robertsons of Struan, or Strowan, in Perthshire,
who descended from Duncan de Atholia, Earl of
Athole, hence descendants of Duncan, King of Scotland.
My grandfather, the 4th Baron Rokeby, in an unfinished
pedigree, believed this, but there have been Robinsons
bearing the same<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5">[5]</a> coat-of-arms in Yorkshire as early
as the time of copyhold record in Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>’s reign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
However, they may have been related. Our narrative
starts from William, said to be younger son of
the 7th Baron Robertson of Strowan, who, being
deprived of his portion of inheritance as younger son
by the Earl of Athole, fled into England, and settled
at Kendal in Westmorland, in the time of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>
He had three children, Ralph, Henry, and Ursula.
Ralph married Agnes Philip, by whom he had William,
who succeeded to his father’s estates at Kendal and
Brignal, and who on June 7, 1610, bought the estate
of Rokeby in Yorkshire from Sir Thomas Rokeby,
whose family had been possessed of it before the Conquest.
Rokeby continued to belong to the Robinson
family for 160 years, when “Long Sir Thomas Robinson”
sold it in 1769 to John B. Saurey Morritt, the
friend of Sir Walter Scott. The Robinsons finally
assumed two lines (<a href="#ROBINSON_PEDIGREE"><i>vide</i> Pedigree</a>), William, the eldest,
remaining master of Rokeby, and his posthumous
brother, Leonard, becoming the direct ancestor of our
heroine. Leonard Robinson was a merchant in London;
he became Chamberlain of the City of London, and was
knighted on October 26, 1692. He married, first, Lucy
Layton, of West Layton, etc., by whom he had no issue.
For his second wife he married Deborah, daughter of
Sir James Collet, Knight and Sheriff of London, by
whom he had six daughters, all of whom married and
had issue, and one son, Thomas, who married a widow,
Elizabeth Light. She was daughter of William
Clarke, Esq., of Merivale Abbey, Warwickshire, and
heiress of her brother, William Clarke. By her first
husband, Anthony Light, she had one daughter, Lydia.
By her second marriage with Thomas Robinson she
had three sons. Matthew, the eldest, alone concerns us

Mrs. Laurence Sterne and her sister, Mrs. Botham,

and his wife “Uncle” and “Aunt,” they being really
their step-uncle and aunt. Thomas Robinson died at
the early age of thirty-three, in the year 1700.</p>

<div class="year">1694</div>
<div class="sidenote">THE MORRIS FAMILY</div>

<p>We now enter on the history of Matthew Robinson,
the eldest surviving son of Thomas, and his wife
Elizabeth. He was born in 1694, therefore was only
six years old when his father died. At an early age he
was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became
a fellow-commoner. He was a person of great intellectual
parts, a conversationalist and wit, the life of
the coffee-houses, which then served, as clubs do nowadays,
as a rendezvous for men of fashion. His talent
for painting was remarkable. His great nephew states,
“He acquired so great a proficiency as to excel most
of the professional artists of his day in landscape.”
At the early age of eighteen, in 1712, he married
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Elizabeth Drake, daughter of Councillor Robert Drake,
of Cambridge, descended from the Drakes of Ashe in
Devonshire. Elizabeth’s mother’s name was Sarah
Morris. The Morris family had been seated in Kent
at East Horton since the reign of Elizabeth. Thomas
Morris, father of Sarah, built the mansion of Mount
Morris, sometimes called Monk’s Horton, near Hythe.
He had one son, Thomas, who was drowned under
London Bridge on his return from Holland in 1697,
ætat 23. His sister Sarah had two children by Councillor
Drake, Morris and Elizabeth. Their maternal grandfather
lived to 1717, when he devised his estates to his
grandson, Morris Drake, with the proviso of his assuming
the extra name of Morris, and failing of his issue
with remainder to Elizabeth, his sister, then Mrs.
Matthew Robinson. Her mother, Mrs. Drake, having
become a widow, had remarried the celebrated Dr.
Conyers Middleton, but had no children by him. The
following table will elucidate this:—</p>

<p>Elizabeth, the subject of this book, was about seven
years old when, by the death of her uncle, Morris
Drake Morris, her mother inherited, as his heir, the
important property of East Horton, and Mount Morris
in Kent. The family then left Yorkshire for residence
at Mount Morris. But before and after their inheritance
of the Kentish property much time was spent with the
Conyers Middletons both at Coveney, Cambridgeshire, a
property Mrs. Conyers Middleton had inherited from
her first husband, Councillor Drake; the advowson of
the living being hers, she bestowed it on her second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
husband, Dr. Conyers Middleton,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7">[7]</a> whom she had
married in 1710; also at Cambridge, where was their
usual residence, and where several of the little Robinsons
were born in their grandmother’s house, as we
learn from a letter of Dr. Middleton’s. Elizabeth
Robinson was naturally much with her grandmother,
with whom and Conyers Middleton she was a great
favourite. Her nephew and adopted son, in his volumes
of her letters<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8">[8]</a> that he published in 1810, states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Her uncommon sensibility and acuteness of understanding,
as well as extraordinary beauty as a child,
rendered her an object of great notice in the University,
and Dr. Middleton was in the habit of requiring from
her an account of the learned conversations at which, in
his society, she was frequently present; not admitting
of the excuse of her tender age as a disqualification, but
insisting that although at the present time she could but
imperfectly understand their meaning, she would in
future derive great benefit from the habit of attention
inculcated by this practice.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their emulation produced a corresponding zeal in

accustomed to struggle for the mastery in wit, or in
superiority in argument, and their mother, whose frame
of mind partook rather of the gentle sedateness of good

by them ‘the Speaker,’ from the frequent mediation
by which she moderated their eagerness for
victory.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT MORRIS —<br>
LADY MARGARET CAVENDISH HARLEY</div>

<p>In <cite>Harris’s “History of Kent,”</cite> published in 1719, on
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 156, is a picture of Mount Morris, the home of the
Robinsons, a large square house with a cupola surmounted
by a ball and a weathercock, surrounded by
a number of walled gardens laid out in the formal
Dutch manner, an inner Topiary garden, leading to a
steep flight of steps to the front door. Whilst staying
in Cambridgeshire, Elizabeth had several times visited
at Wimpole with her father and mother. Wimpole
was the seat of Edward,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9">[9]</a> second Earl of Oxford and
Mortimer, who had married Henrietta Cavendish, only
daughter and heiress of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
She was a great heiress, and brought
her husband £500,000; she is said to have been a good
but a very dull woman, very proud, and a rigid worshipper
of etiquette. In the “<cite>National Biography</cite>” she
is said to have “disliked most of the wits who surrounded
her husband, and hated <em>Pope</em>!”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10">[10]</a> The Earl spent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>enormous sums in collecting books, manuscripts, pictures,
medals, and articles of virtu, spending £400,000 of his
wife’s fortune. To him we are indebted for the Harleian
manuscripts, bought from his widow in 1753 for £10,000
by the nation, now in the British Museum. With the
Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11">[11]</a> only child of the
Earl and Countess of Oxford, Elizabeth became on
the most intimate terms, and her first extant letter is
addressed to her when she was only eleven years old,
and the Lady Margaret eighteen. So greatly did Lady
Margaret value Elizabeth’s letters, that for a series of
years she preserved them between the leaves of an old
grey book which I possess. The first letter is endorsed,
“Received, February 24, 1731–2, at Wimpole.” It commences—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Your ladyship’s commands always give me a
great deal of pleasure, but more especially when you
ordered me to do myself this honour, without which I
durst not have taken that liberty, for it would have been
as great impertinence in me to have attempted it as it is
condescension in your ladyship to order it.”</p>
</div>

<p>This alludes evidently to Lady Margaret having
desired her to write to her. It ends—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My duty to my Lord and Lady Oxford, and

<div class="year">1731–32</div>

<p>The formal terms in this letter were then considered
essential, even when addressing those of lower birth,
all the more so to a person of Lady Margaret’s rank.
Viscount Dupplin, whose name frequently occurs in the
letters, was a cousin of Lady Margaret’s on her father’s
side, his mother being a daughter of Robert Harley,
1st Earl of Oxford. The two young friends now kept
up a lively correspondence, but as many of the letters
have been published by my grandfather in 1810, I shall
for this early period of her life give only a <i>résumé</i> of
them, picking out such facts as point to the manners of
the time, or that strike one as of interest. From Mount
Morris in August, 1732, she writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since I came here I have been to Canterbury Races,
at which there was not much diversion, as only one
horse ran for the King’s Plate.... We had an assembly
for three nights; the rooms are so small and low that
they were exceedingly hot.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this date one perceives that young ladies were
allowed to appear in public early, as Elizabeth was then
not quite twelve years old!</p>

<div class="year">1733</div>

<div class="sidenote">TUNBRIDGE WELLS</div>

<p>In October, 1733, she paid, in company of her parents,
her first visit to Tunbridge Wells, ever afterwards such
a favourite resort of hers. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is so pleasant a place I don’t wonder the physicians
prescribe it as a cure for the spleen; a great part of the
company, especially of the gentlemen, are vapoured.
When the wind is not in the east they are very good
company, but they are as afraid of an easterly wind as if
it would bring caterpillars upon our land as it did on the
land of Egypt.... I am very sorry I could not get you
any verses at Tunbridge, of which, at the latter part of
the season, when the garrets grow cheap, that the poets
come down, there is commonly great plenty.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>Further on she says, “I thank your ladyship for the
verses, and I wish I had any to send you in return for
them, but my poet is turned lawyer, and has forsook
the Muses for ‘Coke upon Littleton.’” This alludes
to her brother Tom, who was then studying law. The
collecting of verses on every sort of circumstance seems
to have been as fashionable then as photograph, autograph,
or stamp-collecting, etc., are now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MRS.” PLACE</div>

<p>In the next letter of November, 1733, she alludes
to Dr. Conyers Middleton, who, as stated before, had
married Mrs. Drake, Elizabeth’s grandmother, and who
was now a widower—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose you have heard Dr. Middleton has
brought his Cousin Place<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14">[14]</a> to keep his house. He very
gravely sent us word that his cousin had come to spend
the winter with him, and it was not impossible they
might agree for a longer time; so I fancy he has
brought her with him to see if she likes to play at
quadrille, and sup on sack posset with the grave
doctors, whose company to one of her gay temper must
be delightful. I suspected his designs when he made
so many complaints in London, that it was so very
difficult to find a maid who understood making jellies
and sack posset, which he and a certain doctor used
to have for their suppers. He lost one lady because
she was deaf to him; but I believe that fortune, to
make amends to him, has blinded this. For though
I don’t doubt he always takes care to show her the
side of his face which Mr. Doll says is younger by
ten years than the other, yet that is rather too old to
be a match for twenty-five, which I believe is the age of
Mrs.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15">[15]</a> Place.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" title="Return to text.">[14]</a> Mary, daughter of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Conyers Place, of Dorchester. She died

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" title="Return to text.">[15]</a> It was the custom at this time to give spinster ladies the
complimentary title of “Mrs.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>The next letter she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not heard from Dr. Middleton a great while.
I suppose his thoughts are taken up with business and
his pretty cousin in the West. I don’t know whether
she has made a complete conquest of his heart.”</p>
</div>

<p>In May, 1733—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Middleton now owns his marriage. I wish he
finds the felicity of it answers his resigning a £100 a
year. I am glad, for the sake of any other family, he
has not got another rich widow; if he had, it would have
been her turn to resign.”</p>
</div>

<p>This alludes to the fact that on the learned doctor’s
remarriage he had to resign his fellowship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. ROBINSON</div>

<p>Mr. Robinson, Elizabeth’s father, was not fond of the
country, where his wife’s fine estate and his nine children
condemned him to reside the greater part of the year;
and when we consider how young a man he was, then
only thirty-one, and his great love of witty society, one
cannot be surprised at his having attacks of the “hyp”
or “vapours,” as the terms for ennui were then. Elizabeth
writes to Lady Margaret from Mount Morris—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though I am tired of the country, to my great
satisfaction I am not so much so as my Pappa; he is a
little vapoured, and last night, after two hours’ silence,
he broke out with a great exclamation against the

<div class="sidenote">THE DUCHESS OF PORTLAND</div>

<p>On July 11, 1734, Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley
married William, 2nd Duke of Portland.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17">[17]</a> There
are no letters of Elizabeth’s in my possession on the
occasion of her friend’s marriage; they recommence
October 20 in the same year. Henceforward all the
duchess’s letters were franked by the duke, and many
of Elizabeth’s, often unfortunately undated. At this
period ladies prevailed on such of their friends as
were either Peers or members of Parliament, to sign
sheets of letter-paper with their names at the back, often
of folio size, which they used free of cost as they wanted
them, wrapping their letters in these outer sheets and
sealing them. As a single letter from London to
Edinburgh cost 1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i>, if double 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, and if treble
3<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i>, the smallest inclosure being treated as an
additional sheet, to send letters unfranked was a costly
luxury. The practice of forging people’s names led to
such intolerable abuse of franking that an Act was
passed in 1764 making it compulsory for the whole
address to be written by the person franking the
letter.</p>

sent it immediately to Canterbury by the servant of a

would be the mortification, that instead of having the

in the footman’s pocket with greasy gloves, rotten
apples, a pack of dirty cards, and the only companion of
its sort, a tender epistle from his sweetheart, ‘tru tell
deth.’ Perhaps by its situation subject to be kicked by
his master every morning, till at last, by ill-usage and
rude company, worn too thin for any other use, it may
make its exit in lighting a tobacco-pipe. I believe the

Elizabeth, eventually wife of the 1st Marquis of Bath.
Elizabeth writes to congratulate her, and states she
heard Dr. Mead (then the great ladies’ doctor) pronounced
it the finest child he ever saw. Elizabeth had
just returned from her first visit to Tunbridge Wells for
her health, suffering much from headaches and weak
eyes. At this period the <em>Dowager</em> Duchess of Portland
died. The letters up to this date were addressed to “To
Her Grace, The junior Duchess of Portland.”</p>

Tunbridge Wells. After comments on an unhappy
marriage recently made, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You know some of our Grub Street wits compared
marriage to a country dance, which scheme I
extremely approved, but when I read it, I thought it
should have been set to the tune of ‘Love for ever;’
but they say it never did go to that tune, nor ever
would. I danced twice a week all the time I was at
Tunbridge, and once extraordinary, for Lord Euston<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25">[25]</a>
came down to see Lord Augustus Fitzroy,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26">[26]</a> and made a
ball. Lord Euston danced with the Duchess of Norfolk,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27">[27]</a>
but her Grace went home early, and then Lord Euston
danced with Lady Delves. We all left off about one
o’clock. The day after I left the Wells, I went to the
Races (Canterbury), which began on Monday, and ended
on Thursday.... Monday there was an Assembly,
Tuesday a Play, Wednesday an Assembly again, and
Thursday another play, and as soon as that was over,
we had a ball where we had ten couple. I did not go to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>bed after our private ball till six o’clock, and rose again
before nine.</p>

<p>“The person who was taken most notice of at Tunbridge

ago to which she did our family the honour to invite
them, and as we were obeying her commands and got
into the coach with our ball airs and our dancing shoes,
at five miles of our journey we met with a brook so
swelled by the rain it looked like a river, and the water,
we were told, was up to the coach seat, and as I had
never heard of any balls in the Elysian Fields, and don’t
so much as know whether the ghosts of departed beaux
wear pumps, I thought it better to reserve ourselves for
the Riddotto<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36">[36]</a> than hazard drowning for this ball, and
so we turned back and went to Sir Wyndham Knatchbull’s,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37">[37]</a>
who were hindered by the same water; for my
part I could think of nothing but the ball, when any one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>asked me how I did I cry’d tit for tat, and when they
bid me sit down, I answered ‘Jack of the green.’ A few
days after the ball, Lady Thanet bespoke a play at a

of my brothers, and my sister,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38">[38]</a> and your humble servant
went, and after the play the gentlemen invited all the

respective homes. Here I suppose you will think my
diversion ended, but I must tell your Grace it did not;
for before I had gone two miles, I had the pleasure of
being overturned, at which I squalled for joy; and to
complete my felicity I was obliged to stand half an hour
in the most refreshing rain, and the coolest north breeze
I ever felt; for the coach’s braces breaking were the
occasion of our overturn, and there was no moving till
they were mended. You may suppose we did not lose
so favourable an opportunity of catching cold; we all
came croaking down to breakfast the next morning, and
said we had caught no cold, as one always says when
one has been scheming, but I think I have scarce recovered
my treble notes yet. We had seven coaches at
the play; there was Lord Winchilsea,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39">[39]</a> Lady Charlotte

Palmer caught such colds they sent for a physician the
next day; Lady Knatchbull and Miss Knatchbull have
kept their beds ever since: poor Lady Thanet was overturned
as she went home, and caught a terrible hoarseness,
which was the better for the poor coachman, who
by that means escaped a sharp and shrill reproof; and
indeed it is enough for any poor man to lye under the
terror of her frowns, with a look she can wound, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>frown she can kill; I think I never saw so formidable a
countenance. I think Lord Thanet’s education of his
son<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43">[43]</a> is something particular; he encourages him in
swearing and singing nasty ballads with the servants:
he is a very fine boy, but prodigiously rude; he came
down to breakfast the other day when there was company,
and his maid came with him, who, instead of
carrying a Dutch toy, or a little whirligig for his Lordship
to play with, was lugging a billet for his plaything.
There was a fine supper at the ball, 33 dishes all very
neat. My elder brother got out of the coach and put on
a pair of boots, and rode on to the ball when we turned
back.”</p>

<p>At this period, though undated, may be placed Elizabeth’s
request to her father for a handsome suit of
clothes. In a letter to her mother she thanks her “for
your goodness in giving me leave to stay, and making it
convenient to answer the Duchess’s and my wishes to
stay during her confinement. When we came to town
the Duchess reckoned the end of April.” From Bullstrode,
therefore, she accompanied the duchess and her
family to Whitehall, where in a portion of the old palace
was the Portlands’ town residence. Elizabeth was now
in her eighteenth year. In a letter to her father, too
lengthy to insert entirely, worded in the respectful
way children addressed their parents then, with “Sir”
and “Madam,” and concluding with “your most dutiful
daughter,” she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You know this year I am to be introduced by the
Duchess to the best company in the town, and when she
lies in, am both to receive in form with her all her visits
as Lady Bell<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46">[46]</a> used to do on that occasion, all the people
of quality of both sexes that are in London, and I must
be in full dress, and shall go about with her all the
winter, therefore a suit of cloathes will be necessary for
me, the value of which I submit entirely to you. I shall
never so much want a handsome suit as upon this occasion
of first appearing with my Lady Duchess; but as
the first consideration is to please you, I would by no
means urge this beyond your pleasure, by duty or inclination,
I shall always be content with what you order,
and hope you will not be displeased with my requests.”</p>

BEGINNING OF CORRESPONDENCE WITH MRS. DONNELLAN.</span></h2>

<div class="year">1738</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> April 16, 1738, the Duchess of Portland’s son,
William Henry, afterwards 3rd Duke, was born, after
which Elizabeth returned home with her father. On
June 30 the duchess wrote to apologize for a long
silence—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should have answered dear Fidget’s letter before
I left London, but you are sensible what a hurry one
lives in there, and particularly after being confined some
months from public diversions, how much one is engaged
in them, Operas, Park, Assemblies, Vaux Hall—which
I believe you never had the occasion of seeing. You
must get your Papa to stay next year: it is really insufferable
going out of town at the most pleasant time
of the year. I am positive the easterly winds have
much greater effect upon the spirits in the country,
than it is possible they should have in London. I
dare say the chief part of the year your Papa is in town
he don’t know which way the wind is, except when he
goes into a Coffee House and meets with some poor
disbanded Officer who is quarrelling with the times
and consequently with the weather, because he is not a
General in time of peace; or a valetudinarian, that if a
fly settled on his nose, would curse the Easterly wind,
and fancy it had sent it there; these are the only people
that ever thought of East wind in London.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>
<p>At the end of the letter the duchess says, “My
amusements are all of the Rural kind—Working, Spinning,
Knotting, Drawing, Reading, Writing, Walking,
and picking Herbs to put into an Herbal.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR ROBERT AUSTIN</div>

<p>This little peep of her life is most characteristic,
though fond of the pleasures of high society diversions,
and the varieties of London, she took an interest in all
sorts of country and domestic pursuits, and excelled in
them. She turned in wood and ivory; she was familiar
with every kind of needlework; she made shell frames,
adorned grottoes, designed feather work, collected
endless objects in the animal and vegetable kingdom;
was a hearty lover of animals and birds of all kinds.
Her letters are lively and affectionate, but not clever
and witty as her friend Elizabeth Robinson’s. She
complains of her stupidity in letter-writing. Elizabeth
had the witty head, and the duchess the cunning hand,
but both possessed that valuable possession, warm
hearts. To the duchess’s last letter Elizabeth replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I arrived at Mount Morris rather more fond of
society than solitude. I thought it no very agreeable
change of scene from Handel<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49">[49]</a> and Cafferelli.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50">[50]</a>... Sir
Francis Dashwood’s sister is going to be married to Sir
Robert Austin, a baronet of our county; if the size of
his estate bore any proportion to the bulk of his carcase,
he would be one of the greatest matches in England ...
a lady may make her lover languish till he is the size
she most likes ... as it is the fashion for men to die for
love, the only thing a woman can do is to bring a man
into a consumption; what triumph then must attend the
lady who reduces Sir Robert Austin ... to asses’ milk.
Omphale made Hercules spin, but greater glory awaits
the lady who makes Sir Robert Austin lean.... I told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>my Pappa how much he laid under your Grace’s displeasure
for hurrying out of town: but what is a fine
lady’s anger, or the loss of London, to five and forty?
They are more afraid of an easterly wind than a frown
when at that age.”</p>

THE GOAT</div>

<p>On December 17 Elizabeth writes to the duchess
in answer to a string of queries the latter had sent
her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I must take the liberty to advise what is to be done,
and to avoid confusion will take them in the order of
the letter. Item, for the wet-nurse<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51">[51]</a> after the chickenpox,
that she may become new milch again, a handful of
Camomile flowers, a handful of Pennyroyal, boiled in
white wine, and sweetened with treacle, to be taken at
going to rest. For my Lord Titchfield who grows
prodigiously, Daisy roots and milk. For the small
foot and taper ancle of my Lady Duchess, bruised and
strained by a fall, a large shoe and oil Opodeldock.
For the horse whose Christian name I have forgotten,
Friar’s Balsam, and for the death of a dormouse take
four of the fairest Moral and Theological Virtues, with
patience and fortitude, quantum sufficit, and they will
prevent immoderate grieving.... I heard a very ridiculous
story a few days ago: Mr. Page, brother to Sir
Gregory, going to visit Mr. Edward Walpole,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52">[52]</a> a tame
goat which was in the street followed him unperceived
when he got out of the coach into the house. Mr.
Walpole’s servant, thinking the goat came out of Mr.
Page’s coach, carried it into the room to Mr. Walpole,
who thought it a little odd Mr. Page should bring such a
visitor, as Mr. Page no less admired at his choice of so
savoury a companion; but civility, a great disguiser of
sentiments, prevented their declaring their opinions, and
the goat, no respecter of persons or furniture, began to
rub himself against the frame of a chair which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>carved and gilt, and the chair, which was fit for a
Christian, but unable to bear the shock of a beast, fell
almost to pieces. Mr. Walpole thought Mr. Page very
indulgent to his dear crony the goat, and wondering he
took no notice of the damage, said he fancied tame goats
did a great deal of harm, to which the other said he
believed so too: after much free and easy behaviour of
the goat, to the great detriment of the furniture, they
came to an explanation, and Mr. Goat was turned downstairs
with very little ceremony or good manners....
Dr. Middleton has got two nieces whom he is to keep
entirely, for his brother left them quite destitute. They
are very fine children, and my Grannam is very fond of
them. The doctor is soon to bring forth his ‘<cite>Cicero</cite>,’
everybody says the production will do him credit. Lady
Thanet has set an assembly on foot about eight miles from
hence, where we all meet at the full moon and dance till
12 o’clock, and then take an agreeable journey home.
Our assembly in full glory has ten coaches at it; and
Lady Thanet, to make up a number, is pleased in her
humility to call in all the parsons, apprentices, tradesmen,
apothecaries, and farmers, milliners, mantua-makers,
haberdashers of small wares, and chambermaids. It is
the oddest mixture you can imagine—here sails a reverent
parson, there skips an airy apprentice, here jumps a
farmer, and then every one has an eye to their trade;
the milliner pulls you by the hand till she tears your
glove; the mantua-maker treads upon your petticoat
till she unrips the seams; the shoemaker makes you
foot it till you wear out your shoes; the mercer dirties
your gown; the apothecary opens the window behind
you to make you sick. Most of our neighbours will be
in town by the next moon, so we shall have no more
balls this winter. In town the ladies talk of their stars,
but here, ‘If weak women go astray, the moon is more
in fault than they.’ Will o’ Whisp never led the
bewildered traveller over hedge or ditch as a moon
does us country folk; a squeaking fiddle is an occasion,
and a moonlight night an opportunity, to go ten miles in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
bad roads at any time. I must tell your Grace that my
Papa forgets twenty years and nine children, and dances
as nimbly as any of the Quorum, but is now and then
mortified by hearing the ladies cry, ‘Old Mr. Robinson
hay sides, and turn your daughter:’ other ladies who
have a mind to appear young say, ‘Well, there is my
poor Grandpapa; he could no more dance so.’ Then
comes an old bachelor of fifty and shakes him by the
hand, and cries, ‘Why you dance like us young fellows:’
another more injudicious than the rest, says by way of
compliment, ‘Who would think you had six fine children
taller than yourself? I protest if I did not know you
I should take you to be young.’ Then says the most
antiquated Virgin in the company, ‘Mr. Robinson wears
mighty well; my mother says he looks as well as ever
she remembers him; he used often to come to the house
when I was a girl.’ You may suppose he has not the
‘hyp’ at these balls; but indeed it is a distemper so well
bred as never to come but when people are at home and
at leisure.”</p>

Canterbury girls who could aspire no higher than a
younger brother, are very angry, and say they shall never
put their cause into his hands, as he seems so little
willing to defend it.... Next year we must certainly
go to the Races for the good of the county, and dance out
of the spirit of Patriotism. The Election year always
brings company to Canterbury upon this occasion, and
as for me I will dance to either a Whig or a Tory tune,
as it may be, for in any wise I will dance. I am not like
the dancing Monkies who will only cut their capers for
King George, I will dance for any man or Monarch in
Christendom, nay were it even a Mahometan or idolatrous
King; I should not make much scruple about it. I had
the misfortune to be overturned the other day coming
from Sir Wyndham Knatchbull’s,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56">[56]</a> the occasion of it
was one of our wheels coming off. I assure you I but
just avoided the indecency of being topsy turvey, my
head was so much lower than its usual situation, as put
my ideas much out of place, and I think my head has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
been in a perfect litter ever since.... I shall begin to
think from my frequent overturns a bone-setter a
necessary part of equipage for country visiting. I am
sure those who visit much, love their neighbours better
than themselves; perhaps you will be as apt to suspect
me as anybody of that extream of charity, but I am so
tender of myself there are few I would hazard even a
gristle or a sinew, but civility is a debt that must be
paid. I hope in all accidents I shall preserve a finger
and thumb, to write myself</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF PORTLAND</div>

<p>The duchess was now expecting her confinement,
and Lady Wallingford, who was staying with her,
corresponded with Elizabeth in French. Owing to
the residence of her father in France as Superintendent
of Finances, she was more French than English.
Her letters are well written and expressed, though the
spelling is peculiar. At a later date she writes to
Elizabeth in broken English, and she scolds her for
making her correspond in English instead of French.
Horace Walpole, in a letter to the Earl of Buchan,
states that Lady Wallingford was the image of her
father, and that her mother, Lady Katherine Law, lived
during her husband’s power in France in great state.
On July 26, 1739, another daughter, Lady Margaret, was
born to the duchess. Dr. Sandys was, as usual, the
accoucheur, but it makes one horrified in these days to
think Dr. Sandys <em>bled</em> the duchess for a feverish cold
on the Monday and Thursday after her child was born.
Truly under this San Grado treatment it was then
the “survival of the fittest”! The duke now wrote a
bulletin of his wife to Elizabeth—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Whitehall, August 9, 1739.</p>

</div>

<div class="signed">“<span class="smcap">Portland</span>.”</div>

</div>

<p>The duke’s writing is very characteristic, but certainly
rather disjointed looking, and his I’s always
written as long j’s.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had just had another coach adventure.
The coachman who drove her father and mother and
her brother Matthew home after dining at a neighbour’s,
was drunk, which they did not perceive till he lashed
the four horses into a furious gallop. In vain Mr.
Robinson called to him, and swore at him; Matthew and
Mrs. Robinson intreated; he persisted in lashing the
horses till he fell off the box, and two wheels ran over
him, but as Elizabeth states, “being preserved in beer,
took very little harm; both footmen were drunk, so took
very little care about us.”</p>

<p>In a letter to the duchess (August 15) we find
Elizabeth and her sister Sarah banished from home to
Canterbury on account of a woman and three children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
who lived in a farmhouse near the gate of Mount
Morris having the smallpox. That fell disease ever
inspired Elizabeth with great dread. Later in life at
three different times she was inoculated,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57">[57]</a> each time unsuccessfully,
for this disease, then a universal scourge.
I should like the foolish fathers and mothers of the
present day who petition for non-vaccination to read the
accounts given in letters I possess of the unbridled
ravages then made by smallpox, and to consider that a
usually temporary inconvenience to the child’s health is
a very trifling infliction compared with a loathsome
disease, which many people fled from nursing, and
which even if it did not kill the sufferers, probably disfigured
them for life. The sisters first stayed with Mrs.
Scott,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58">[58]</a> and then with Mrs. Tennison, “wife to a prebend
in this church; there is very little company here,
except Deans, Prebends and Minor Canons, etc., etc.;
nothing but messages and visits from Prebends, Deacons,
and the Church militant upon earth.” Later on, speaking
of her brother Matthew’s refusal to leave home on
account of the smallpox, she says, “I have seven
brothers, and would not part with one for a kingdom;
and if I had but one, I should be distracted about him;
sure nobody has so many or so good brothers.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFLUENZA —<br>
THE SMALLPOX</div>

<p>Meanwhile the duchess had a return of fever, and
was for some days in great danger. On August 28
Lady Wallingford writes to say she was out of danger.
Influenza was rife then, and Lady Wallingford states
that she had not a single lackey fit to attend her from
her house to Whitehall, but had walked there by herself,
though still suffering from its effects. It was not then
called influenza, but from the description must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
been that disease. Eight out of the nine in the farm
at Mount Morris caught the smallpox, and the duke,
writing to Elizabeth on September 15, a bulletin about
his wife, adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Both she and j<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59">[59]</a> join in entreating you not to venture
yourself, and that pretty face of yours, to come within

</div>
</div>

<p>After her visit to Canterbury, Elizabeth spent a
month at Mersham Hatch with the Knatchbulls. She
now became seriously indisposed; her health was always
frail, and she appears to have suffered much from headaches
at this period. In a letter to the duchess she
complains—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have swallowed the weight of an Apothecary in
medicine, and what I am the better for it, except more
patient, and less credulous, I know not. I have learnt
to bear my infirmities and not to trust to the skill of
Physicians for curing them. I endeavour to drink
deeply of Philosophy, and to be wise when I cannot be
merry, easy when I cannot be glad, content with what
cannot be mended, and patient where there be no
redress. The mighty can do no more, and the wise
seldom do as much.”</p>
</div>

<p>On October 10 she announces that she and her
mother, who had been extremely unwell too, had been
advised to drink the Bath waters, and were to be
accompanied there by her father. She hopes to see the
duchess on her way to Bath, but bids her tell her porter
to admit her, as she has grown so thin—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“he will think it is my ghost and shut the door. I
shall stay but a few days in town and then proceed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
my Father and Mother, to the waters of life and
recovery. My Pappa’s chimney ‘hyp’ will never
venture to attack him in a public place; it is the sweet
companion of solitude and the off-spring of meditation,
the disease of an idle imagination, not the child of hurry
and diversion. I am afraid that with the gaiety of the
place, and the spirits the waters give, I shall be perfect
Sal-Volatile, and open my mouth and evaporate.... I
was a month at Hatch, where the good humour of the
family makes everything agreeable; we had great variety
in the house—children in cradles, and old women in
elbow chairs. I think the family may be looked upon
as the three tenses, the present, past and future.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">COTTAGE LIFE</div>

<p>On a fresh scare being caused by the illness of her
maid, which the old women of the parish pronounced
to be smallpox, Mrs. Robinson sent Elizabeth and Sarah
to the cottage of the carpenter hard by without delay,
though so late that Elizabeth writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I arrived at my new lodging but the moment
before it was time to go to bed, where I slept pretty
well, notwithstanding the goodman and his wife snored,
the little child cryed, the maid screamed, one little boy
had whooping cough, another roared with chilblains.
The furniture of our chamber is extraordinary, the
ornamental parts as follows:—on the mantelpiece four
stone tea-cups, four wineglasses, two broken, two
leaden cherubims, a piece of looking-glass, with a
‘beggerly account of empty bottles,’ as Shakespeare
calls it, a print of King Charles the Martyr, the woeful
ballad of the children in the wood, a pious copy of
verses entitled ‘the believer’s gold chain, or good
councell for all men,’ with a resplendent brass warming
pan, in which my sister is dressing her head to the disadvantage
of her complexion, and not much to the
rectitude of her head-dress.”</p>
</div>

<p>The alarm proved to be false as to the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the maid’s illness, and they returned the next day to
the paternal mansion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EDMUND CURLL</div>

<p>On November 12 Elizabeth writes from Bath to her
sister a long and indignant letter upon some poems
brought out in the name of Prior. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I got at last this morning the poems just published
under Prior’s<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60">[60]</a> name, brought them home under my
arm, locked my door, sat me down by my fireside, and
opened the book with great expectation, but to my disappointment
found it to be the most wretched trumpery
that you can conceive, the production of the meanest of
Curl’s<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61">[61]</a> band of scribblers.”</p>

<p>She continues to inveigh against this forgery in
eloquent terms, and towards the end of the letter remarks
“that mankind can’t support above two dead languages
at a time, so as to have any tolerable knowledge
or use of them, therefore in all probability Shakespeare,
Milton, Dryden, Prior, and Pope are but short-lived, in
comparison of those Methuselahs the Classicks.”</p>

arrived here a good deal tired: if Scarron<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62">[62]</a> had not
been very facetious, my countenance had not received
the impression of a smile since I left Whitehall till my

morning after I arrived, I went to the Ladies’ Coffee
House, where I heard of nothing but the rheumatism in
the shoulder, the sciatica in the hip, and the gout in the
toe. After these complaints I began to fancy myself
in the Hospitals or Infirmaries; I never saw such an
assembly of disorders. I dare say Gay<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64">[64]</a> wrote his fable
of the ‘<cite>Court of Death</cite>’ from this place. After drinking
the waters I go to breakfast, and about 12 I drink
another glass of water, and then dress for dinner; visits
employ the afternoon, and we saunter away the evening
in great stupidity. I think no place can be less agreeable.
‘How d’ye do?’ is all one hears in the morning,
and ‘What’s trumps?’ in the afternoon. Lady Berkshire<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65">[65]</a>

inquired much about your health. Lord Berkshire<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66">[66]</a> is
literally speaking laid by the leg, which the gout has
usurped, for it has ever been a distemper of very great

<p>“I think Lord Noel’s wife must be happy, and Miss
Berkeley is a very deserving woman, and good-natured.
Everybody is content except those who would have
liked the gentleman for themselves.... A man of merit,
and a younger brother is a purchase only for a large
fortune; as for those who have more merit than wealth,
they must turn the penny by disposing of their useless
virtues for riches, the exchange may sometimes be
difficult, Virtues not being sterling, nor merit the coin
of the nation.... Gold is the chief ingredient in the
composition of worldly happiness. Living in a cottage
on love is certainly the worst diet and the worst habitation
one can find out. As for modern marriages they
are great infringers of the baptismal vow; for ’tis
commonly the pomps and vanities of this wicked world
on one side and the simple lust of the flesh on the other
side. For my part when I marry I do not intend to
enlist entirely under the banner of Cupid or Plutus, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>take prudent consideration and decent inclination for
my advisers; I like a coach and six extremely, but a
strong apprehension of repentance would not suffer me
to accept it from many who possess it....</p>

<div class="sidenote">FROST FAIR</div>

<p>In January, 1740, the weather was so severe, a frost
fair was held on the Thames for weeks together; booths,
tents, and shows of all kinds were the order of the
day. In a letter to the duchess this is alluded to
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What will the world come to now the Duchesses
drink gin, and frequent Fairs? I am afraid your gentlemen
did not pledge you, or they might have resisted the
frost and the fatigue by the strength of that comfortable
liquor. I want much to know if your Grace got a ride
in the Flying Coach, which is part of the diversion of a
Fair.... I am much obliged to your Grace for forming
schemes for me. If any castles come to my share they
must be airy ones, for I have no material to build them
on Terra Firma. I am not a good chimerical architect,
and besides I would rather dwell this summer in a small
room in a certain mansion near Gerrard’s Cross,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81">[81]</a> than
in the most spacious building I could get. I shall not
be troublesome to you in town, for our stay here will be
so long that our family will hardly go down till May.

<div class="sidenote">MRS. DONNELLAN</div>

<p>A letter from Mrs. Donnellan, with whom Elizabeth
had struck up a lively friendship, and entered into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
correspondence, is dated from London, April, 1740,
portions of which I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since my last I passed a most agreeable day with
your friend and mine; the Duke and Duchess of Portland
proposed a jaunt into the city to see city shows,
and were so obliging as to ask me with Mrs. Pendarves
to be of the party. We were four men, four women:
our fourth woman was Lady Wallingford, whom I never
saw before; but she seems good-natured and civil; our
four men, the Duke, Lord Dupplin, Mr. Achard,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82">[82]</a> and
Dr. Shaw,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83">[83]</a> all new to me. We set out at ten in two
hackney coaches, and stopped at everything that had a
name between us and the Tower, going and coming, and
dined at a city Tavern. I am extremely glad your time
is fixed for coming to us, and that we shall have you a
month. You will find the rage for whist<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84">[84]</a> a little abated,
I hope, if the weather and Vaux Hall is in its lustre.
You are right in quarrelling with the men for letting
cards take their places in the ladies’ hearts, for I dare say
they would rather hear the gentlemen say fine things,
than win a Slam, and it is a want of gallantry in the
men that runs the women into cards; for something we
must have to stir our passions, or life seems dull. Your
account of Bath folks diverted me much.... My present
delight is the fine lady who admires and hates to excess;
she doats on the dear little boy that dances, she detests
Handel’s Oratorios; indeed she don’t say she admires
Mademoiselle de Chateauneuf’s kicking the tambourine,
till she shows herself naked to the waist. She owns it
is indecent, but she goes constantly to see her. I don’t
know whether you have heard of the kicking entertainment?
I have not seen it, but I have heard it very
lively described; she kicks twice for the King, and once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
for the audience, to the great edification of the spectators.
I suppose you have heard of the false dice at the last
masquerade. I fancy it must have been a pretty sight,
a dozen Dominoes, at five in the morning examined before
Justice de Val: I think they should have been all Devils
with Horns and Hoofs. I saw the Duke and Duchess of
Portland yesterday morning at Zincke’s,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85">[85]</a> where she and

<div class="sidenote">THE PLUNGE BATH</div>

<p>Elizabeth suffering much still from headaches, Dr.
Sandys was consulted, and he recommended the plunge
bath. This was at Marylebone, at the then popular
gardens. This was considered a hazardous exploit, and
she first wrote to ask her parents’ consent. Writing to
Sarah, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you was to see me souse into the cold bath, you
would think I had not sense or feeling.... The Duchess
went with me the first time, and was frightened out
of her wits, but I behaved much to my honour. Mrs.
Verney went to learn to go in of me. Mrs. Pendarves
went with me to-day, and was as pale as a ghost with
the fear of my being drowned, which you know is impossible.
I go in every day and have found benefit
already; but there are two things I dislike, viz. the
pain of going overhead, and the expense of the bath.
The Duke and Duchess are very good in lending me
the coach every morning to Marrybone, which is two
miles from here, but the bath was better than any at
Charing Cross: the Duchess says if there is any bath,
as she thinks there is in their neighbourhood at Bullstrode,
she will send me to it, a tub not being near so
good.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>
<p>The whole parish of Marylebone belonged to the
Duchess of Portland. There were nine springs of water

and ‘Dash,’<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89">[89]</a> Lord George<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90">[90]</a> and ‘Fidget,’ Lord Howard
and Miss Cesar, Mr. Granville<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91">[91]</a> and Miss Tatton, Mr.
Howard and another Miss Cesar. The partners were
chosen by their fans, but a little supercherie in the case
of one of our dancers appointed failed, so our worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>cousin Sir Tommy<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92">[92]</a> was sent for, and he came, but when
he had drawn Miss Cesar’s fan he would not dance with
her, but Mr. Hay,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93">[93]</a> who as the more canonical diversion,
chose cards, danced with the poor forsaken damsel.
The Knight bore the roast with great fortitude, and to
make amends promised his neglected Fair a ball at his
house. I believe in his economy he saves a dinner
when invited to supper, for he eat a forequarter of lamb,
a chicken, with a plentiful portion of ham, potted beef
and jellies innumerable, and made a prodigious breakfast
of bread and butter and coffee, a little after two in
the morning.... I sat for my picture<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94">[94]</a> this morning to
Zincke; I believe it will be very like. I am in Anne

<p>Mrs. D’Ewes, <i>née</i> Anne Granville, was the beloved
sister of Mrs. Pendarves, recently married to Mr. John
D’Ewes.... In the next letter to her mother she
describes what she calls a “new head,” given to her by
the duchess. “Last Tuesday I put on my New head;
it is extremely handsome, very broad, and the lace
has more thin work in it than has been made till this
year.” To this head was added ruffles and a tucker
by the same donor. Quin was acting then in London.
She writes to Sarah—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been to the play <cite><i>As you Like it</i></cite>. Quin outdid
his usual outdoings. I never heard anything spoke with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
such command of voice and action as the ‘seven stages
of man,’ from the rough bass of the good Justice, ‘whose
round belly with good capon lined,’ till he sunk to the
childish treble; it was really prodigious, the alteration
of the voice, he spoke the slippered pantaloon just like
my Uncle Clark.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95">[95]</a> I saw the facetious Monsieur and
Mademoiselle Fausan dance, but Quin had so possessed

and from thence the Duke and Duchess, Mr. Achard,
Lord George Bentinck, Lady Throckmorton, Mrs.
Collingwood, and Sir Robert Throckmorton<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96">[96]</a> went to

<div class="sidenote">LORD WALLING&#173;FORD’S DEATH</div>

<p>Lady Wallingford was attacked by smallpox at this
time, but had it very favourably. In a letter to Mrs.
Robinson, Elizabeth says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She never had three hundred all over her, and was
at the heighth, I believe, in seven days. Her Lord dyed
very suddenly of a quinsy before she had been downstairs,
so she had not even the melancholy consolation
of a last farewell; she laid up two pairs of stairs, and he
below, so they told her he was removed, and died at
Kensington. He has left everything to her.... Lord
Wallingford certainly caught his death with attending
her, a sad aggravation of the affliction; he died with the
greatest courage imaginable. Sandys, who with several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Physicians and Surgeons was called in, begged him to
settle his affairs, upon which he made his will (that he
had by him, being very deficient in points of Law), and
took leave of his friends. There was no hopes from the
first, for this convulsive Quinsy is always mortal.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another she says he died of “cramp in the throat,”
which sounds more likely. It has been stated that Lord
Wallingford died in France, but his death occurred at
Whitehall.</p>

<p>The duke and family, including Elizabeth, left Whitehall
in June for Bullstrode.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98">[98]</a> In a letter of June 24 to
Mr. Freind and his wife, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The rural beauties of the place would persuade me
I was in the plains of Arcadia, but the magnificence of
the building under whose gilded roof I dwell, has a
pomp far beyond pastoral. We go to chapel twice a week,
and have sermons on Sunday, for his Grace of Portland
values the title of Christian above that of Duke, and
the chaplain may preach against every vice in fashion
without fear of offending either his Patron or Patroness.”</p>
</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" title="Return to text.">[98]</a> Bullstrode was originally in the Shobbington family before the

sold to the Duke of Somerset.</p>

Parrots, and all sorts of foreign birds flying in one of
the woods; he built a house and kept people to wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>

<p>On July 22 occurs this interesting letter to her

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="para1">“Much visiting has of late hindered my writing
to you. My Lady Duchess does not care to spare me to
write except when she is so employed too, and the time
set apart for that is in the evening, and when we make
visits at any distance, it is late before we return, and
letters go from here between 10 and 11. When we first
came down, we supped at 9, but we found so early an
hour encroached too much upon our hours of writing,
so now we sup at 10, at which time the Duke comes
into the Duchess’s dressing-room,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99">[99]</a> where we write
together, and franks our packets. On Saturday, we
were at Windsor to visit the Miss Granvilles, daughters
of the famous Lord Lansdowne;<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100">[100]</a> they unhappily inherit
neither the wit of their Father, nor the beauty of their

Miss Granville was her acquaintance in infancy, and it
is very right in her to take notice of them now. Lord
Weymouth<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102">[102]</a> supports them, but how long he will be
willing or able to do so, no one knows. On Sunday,
I was at Mrs. Hare’s, widow to the late Bishop Hare,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103">[103]</a>

and his family, who are just come from abroad. Lady
Shadwell<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104">[104]</a> saw Lady Mary Wortley at Venice, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>she now resides, and asked her what made her leave
England; she told them the reason was, people were
grown so stupid she could not endure their company,
all England was infected with dullness; by-the-bye,
what she means by insupportable dullness is her
husband,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105">[105]</a> for it seems she never intends to come back
while he lives. A husband may be but a dull creature
to one of Lady Mary’s sprightly genius, but methinks
even her vivacity might accommodate itself to living
in the Kingdom with him; she is a woman of great
family merit, she has banished her children,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106">[106]</a> abandoned
her husband. I suppose as she cannot reach Constantinople,
she will limit her ambition to an intrigue with
the Pope or the Doge of Venice.... The Duke of
Leeds’<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107">[107]</a> wedding was very grand. The Duke of Newcastle’s<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108">[108]</a>
entertainment upon the occasion was 15 dishes
in a course, four courses. The Duchess of Newcastle,
sister to Lady Mary Godolphin, and Mr. Hay are gone
down with the Duke and Duchess of Leeds. The
Duchess had a diamond necklace from her Mother worth
£10,000, she was very fine in cloaths and jewels. The
old Duchess of Marlborough<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109">[109]</a> is now mightily fond of
her. Her Grace is at law with the Duke of Marlbro’;

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. WILLIAM FREIND</div>

<p>Mr. Freind, having written a letter to Elizabeth
expressing a fear that her head might be turned by the
great company, and the splendid place she was residing
in, she replies—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am neither condemning greatness, nor envying it,
but gratefully and cheerfully enjoying what I am. I
thank Providence for the blessings it has given me,
without either despising or wishing for the gifts it has
bestowed on others. I enjoy the present time without
regretting the past, or wishing for that to come, but still
as conducive to happiness, prefer to-day to yesterday
or to-morrow. I keep content for the present, and
hope for the future, and love this life without fearing
another.”</p>

<p>This letter was sent to Witney, Oxon, the seat
of the blanket manufacture. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind
had become Rector there, since the resignation of
his father, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Robert Freind, in the previous
year. His mother was a Miss Jane de l’Angle, daughter
of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Samuel de l’Angle, once pastor of the reformed
church at Charenton, near Paris, who, on the
persecution of Louis XIV., fled to England and was
made a Prebendary of Westminster. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William
Freind built the good stone rectory still existent at
Witney. A medallion portrait of him is over a door
in the Hall. Mrs. Donnellan had been recommended
to drink the waters at Spa in the Ardennes, and, accompanied
by her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Cottington, set out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>

cure as then practised—</p>

Thames, which the Duke of Marlborough<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121">[121]</a> purchased
and has beautified at the expense of £8000. There is
too great an embarras of buildings upon it, the finest
of which I think something resembling the Temple of
Janus. He has a better title to build one to war than
to fame, for he has got a commission, but renown I
believe is what he will never gain. He sent out a few
days ago for four-score workmen to improve a place he
never proposes to live at, after the old Duchess dies.
His Grandfather now saved a people, now saved a groat,

<div class="sidenote">LYDIA BOTHAM —<br>
COUNTESS OF OXFORD</div>

<p>This is the first allusion to Lydia Botham, cousin of
Elizabeth Robinson; she, and her more illustrious sister
Elizabeth, or Eliza Lumley, afterwards wife of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Laurence Sterne, of “Shandean” memory, were the
children of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley, of the Lumley
Castle family, Rector of Bedale, Yorks, from 1721 to
1732; and of Lydia, daughter of Anthony Light,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123">[123]</a> and
widow in 1709 of her first husband, Thomas Kirke,
of Cockridge, near Leeds (a famous Virtuoso), she
married afterwards the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124">[124]</a> for the
table elucidating this pedigree the reader must turn to
the end of the introductory portion of this work. The
Lumleys are said to have been brought up in style, but
little means had remained to them. Both parents were
dead; Lydia had recently married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Botham,
Rector of Yoxall, Staffordshire. Elizabeth Lumley, her
sister, was residing alone in “Little Alice Lane,” under
the shadow of York Cathedral. In a folio-sheet letter
to her sister Sarah, Elizabeth explains that owing to the
Countess of Oxford being at Bullstrode, she had more
time to herself, as the countess and she had spent
alternate mornings with the duchess. The countess
was kind to Elizabeth, but she was a rare admirer of
etiquette. When she was with the duchess, she actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
wished to see all her letters, which was naturally annoying
to a married woman; she also expected them to be
couched in the most formal manner, as addressed <em>to a
ducal person</em>! Hence, when Elizabeth was away from
the duchess, and Lady Oxford was with her, the letters
were often written under cover to the duchess’s two
lady dressers, so as to indulge in fewer formalities;
also, as can be read in <cite>Mrs. Delany’s Memoirs</cite> in letters
from the duchess, nicknames were often set up between
the circle of friends, known only to themselves in case
of their being opened. This passage in the letter will
point to the formality of the circle when including Lady
Oxford—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While our present Guests are here we are so
overcharged with ceremony, we cannot move about,
and as I am not (thanks to the humility of my station),
of the Countess’ cabinet council, I have the morning to
myself. To employ them to my edification, I have laid
in a great store of Italian, which I cannot read with the
Duchess as she has forgotten it so much. I have laid
aside the Arcadia<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125">[125]</a> till Mrs. Pendarves comes, who is
fond of it, and the Duchess and I have agreed that she
shall read it to us.... I beg you will send me the

‘A quire of paper.’”</p>

soon soil, bade Elizabeth work hers on a black ground.

Charlemagne makes his procession round the town,
which is an annual ceremony, and the most solemn

made it an imperial city, and this procession is in

figure, 12 feet high (for they will have him a giant),
he has on his head a very fine curled and powdered
full-bottomed periwig, an Imperial crown on that; downwards,
he has a yellow damask night-gown, which hides
those who carry him. He walks round the city attended
by all the Orders in their different habits (which is a
pretty sight),—the magistracy, and the Host carried
under a canopy. They stopped before the Town House
where we were, and said Mass at an altar raised on
purpose, then they adored the Host, and Charlemagne
stooped and goggled his eyes, which are pulled by
wires, and so the ceremony ended. We landed at Deal

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. DR. YOUNG</div>

<p>On September 23, in a letter of Elizabeth to her
sister, we first hear of Dr. Young, the author of “<cite>Night
Thoughts</cite>.” At this time this celebrated poem was not
written, but various other poems, satires, and tragedies
had made him famous. Edward Young, LL.D., was
born in 1684, educated at Winchester, New College,
and Corpus Christi, Oxford; in 1730 was Rector of
Welwyn, Herts; in 1731 he married Lady Betty Lee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
widow of Colonel Lee, and daughter of the Earl of Lichfield.
The Duke of Wharton was his literary patron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Young is coming soon. We wish for his
coming, for I hear he is agreeable, and, indeed, his
private character is excellent. He sends his compliments
to me when he writes to the Duchess, and says
he is perfectly acquainted with me, and all that is the
vision of a Poet, for I never saw him in my life, but he
is so kind as to commend me and all my works in all
places.”</p>

is with us. I am much entertained with him, he is a
very sensible man, has a lively imagination, and strikes
out very pretty things in his conversation, tho’ he has
satyrized the worst of our sex, he honours the best of
them extremely, and seems delighted with those who
act and think reasonably. I think he has written a
Satire against that composition of oddity, affectation,

<p>“The Duchess of Kent is very agreeable, has good
sense and politeness, and those who know her well say
many valuable qualities. I look upon my Duchess as
the Arch-Duchess, before whom all lesser stars hide
their diminished heads; as for Dr. Young, he is a very
sensible man, and an entertaining companion, and starts
new subjects of conversation, and there is nothing so
much wanted in the country as the art of making the
same people chase new topics without change of
persons. The Duchess and Dr. Young design to leave
us to-morrow.... Dr. Sandys has given Deb quicksilver,
which has been of great service to her, and it
appears that she had worms.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth writes to Sarah on November 1, telling
her she is reading <cite>the “Decameron” of Boccaccio</cite>. The

<p class="para1">“I went to Lady North’s<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135">[135]</a> last night, to see all
the fine cloaths that were made for the Birthday. Lady
Scarborough<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136">[136]</a> was richly dressed, the Duchess of
Bedford<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137">[137]</a> was pretty fine, Mrs. Spencer had a white
velvet which is the ugliest thing in the world, but the
Duchess of Queensberry<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138">[138]</a> was such as should be shown
at Courts and feasts, and high solemnities, where most
may wonder at the workmanship; her cloaths were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>embroidered upon white satin; Vine leaves, Convolvulus
and Rosebuds shaded after Nature; but she in herself
was so far beyond the masterpiece of art, that one
could hardly look at her cloaths; allowing for her age I
never saw so beautiful a creature. Miss Pitt<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139">[139]</a> had a
fine trimming and looked very pretty, but as for the

as a ghost. Lady Mary Tufton<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140">[140]</a> had a pretty suit of
embroidery. The men were not at all fine. Mr.

instructions, ‘Rich not gaudy, fine but not exprest in

stays, I think they are as usual. I do not know
what will become of your fine shape, for there is a

<div class="sidenote">HAIRDRESSING</div>

<p>A light is thrown on hairdressing of the period in
the following letter to Sarah:—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I have been walking in the Park this morning,
and returned only time enough to dress, so while Deb
is tiffing and tiffing till my hair is so pure and so crisp,
I am writing a line to you to the great vexation of Mrs.
Mincing, who is afraid I should be the worst dressed
for it. I don’t wonder an ‘Abigail’ that is kept only as
a Minister of the toilette should look upon dressing as
the great concern of life, but that other people should
make such a point of it I marvel greatly. Some women
by endeavouring to be as handsome as they can are not
so charming as they might be. I never thought a head
agreeably dressed that had not a hair awry; such
punctuality may become a tyre woman, but cannot
a belle, but however, it becomes everybody to be
dressed for dinner, which will not be the case if I
do not conclude. I am to go to the ‘Penseroso and
Allegro’ to-night. The music of the ‘Penseroso’ some
say is best, ‘but Mirth with thee I choose to live.’
Adieu.”</p>
</div>

<p>One can, indeed, pity the unfortunate Abigail with
“Fidget” writing whilst she had her hair dressed!
Once after a visit to Bullstrode, the duchess says she
had found a glass-stand left behind by Elizabeth, should
she send it? And the reply was that the stand was
used for her to rest her chin on whilst her maid dressed
her hair. The ridiculously high coiffure of the day
must have taken a long time to erect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE PEAS”</div>

<p>No letter can I find till April 10, when the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>

were staying, to inquire what had become of his cousins.
Sarah Robinson’s<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143">[143]</a> pet-name was “Pea,” as she was

<p class="from s9">“Bath, April 10, 1741.</p>

<p>“It being now near two months since I have received
any intelligence of either of my correspondents, I must
needs enclose a letter to Pea, Senior, to enquire after
her whether she be still with the Duke to whom I direct
the cover, or with the rest of the Peas in her own Podd
in Kent.</p>

<p>“I expected the beginning of March to hear you had
quitted her grace to join hearts and hands once more
with dearly beloved Pea. But Lady Berkshire whom I
saw some days ago, tells me the Duchess is in a very
bad state of health, which I suppose will make you both
very unwilling to part with each other. I have rather
fancied therefore some disappointment has happened,
and that your friend’s illness may have taken up your
time and thoughts too much to let us hear what is
become of you, for if both sisters had been together in
town, surely both would not have grudged us the
pleasure of hearing you were well and happy.... Even
I, surrounded with a set of noisy politicians on one side,
and backgammon players on t’other, can still make shift
to write a line to my dear friend, and ask only how she
does, and where she is, and to assure her that I and my

<p>The reason of the unaccustomed silence was this—Sarah
was suddenly attacked by smallpox, a disease
peculiarly dreaded by Elizabeth. Mrs. Robinson quickly
despatched her to Hayton Farm, a family property leased
to a yeoman farmer of the name of Smith.</p>

<p>April 8 occurs a letter to the duchess—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I cannot lose the opportunity which just offers me
to send a letter to the post, though I troubled your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Grace but yesterday. My sister continues as well as it
is possible to be, and has found out her disorder with
which she is perfectly content, and sends me very merry
messages upon it: they are of the seven day sort, so
will turn on Sunday, and on Monday when it is over, I
shall possess my soul in quietness. I am afraid this
hurry of spirits and fatigue, will not prove of service to
my Mamma; and if the dire Hyp does haunt a solitary
chimney corner, sure it will visit my Pappa now it is
sure to find him at home and alone. For my part, I am
in the case of poor David, my friends and kinsfolk stand
afar off; and when I am to return home I don’t know.
That the distemper may not continue, my Pappa has
sent away half a dozen servants who have not had it,
and says he hopes to have me back again very soon;
but indeed I hope to prevail upon him to try how the
air of Mount Morris agrees with his servants, before I
return. I live here very easy, and I have got books and
all the necessaries and comforts, though not the pomps
and pleasures of life. The family are civil and sensible
people. As for the Master of the house, he is indeed,
to a tittle, Spenser’s meagre personage called Care: his
chief accomplishment as to behaviour is silence. I never
see him but at dinner and supper, and then he eats his
pudding and holds his tongue. I believe his learning
amounts to knowing that four pennies make a groat, and
the sooner that groat is a sixpence he thinks the better.
To give your grace a notion of the sort of persons who
compose the Drama:—They are above Farmers considerably,
have been possessed in the family, for aught I
know, since the Conqueror of above £400 a year, they
have a good old house, neatly furnished, but there is
nothing of modern structure to be seen in it.</p>

<p>“I am now sitting in an old crimson velvet elbow
chair, I should imagine to be elder brother to that which
is shown in Westminster Abbey as Edward the Confessor’s.
There are long tables in the room that have
more feet than the caterpillar you immured at Bullstrode.
Why so many legs are needful to stand <em>still</em>, I cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>imagine, when I can fidget on two. There is a good
chest of drawers in the figure of a Cathedral, and a
looking glass which Rosamond or Jane Shore may have
dressed their heads in. Not to forget the clock, who
has indeed been a time server; it has struck the blessed
minutes of the Reformation, Restoration, Abdication,
Revolution, and Accession, and by its relation to time
seems to have some to Eternity. It is like its old
Master, only good to point the hour to industry; ...
it calls his servant to yoke the oxen, get ready the
plough, wakes the dairy maid to milk and churn, the
daughters hear in it the paternal voice chiding the waste
of hours, and rise obedient to its early call; even me it
governs, sends me to bed at ten, and makes me rise, oh
barbarous! at eight.... The mother of the family, a
venerable matron of grave deportment, who was well
educated, and moves in the form of antique ceremonies,
but is really a sensible woman! The daughters are
good housewifes, and I like some qualities in them,
which I understand better than their economy. I only
wish they could sleep in their beds in the morning, and
wake in a chair in the evening!” ...</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE AT A FARM —<br>
A COUNTRY SQUIRE</div>

<p>The next letter to Mrs. Donnellan, whom Elizabeth rebukes
for her silence, is dated April 10. In this she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before this time you must have been informed by
the Duchess or Mrs. Pendarves of my distress, and also
my flight from the maternal mansion to the house in the
neighbourhood. I am at present very happy as my
sister is out of all danger, and I rejoice in thinking she
will have one enemy of life and health the less. So
much for the state of my mind; the situation of my
person is not so gay and cheerful. My best friends
among the living are a Colony of rooks who have settled
themselves in a grove by my window. They wake me
early in the morning.... I have not yet discovered the
form of their government, but I imagine it is democratical....
If I continue here long I shall grow a good
naturalist. I have applied myself to nursing chickens,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>and have been forming the manners of a young calf, but
I find it a very dull scholar. I intend to gather some
cowslips for Mrs. Perceval<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145">[145]</a> as soon as they appear;
pray let me know if they should be prepared in any
particular manner....</p>

<p>“There are some squires here who would make
excellent Polyphemus’s; one of them drank tea here
yesterday, and complimented me with all the force of
rural gallantry, but for some fault in the flattery or the
flatterer, I liked neither him nor myself any better for
all the fine things he said. After he was gone I did but
relieve my spleen with some laughter on the subject,
when I was told by the matron of the family, he would
be a good match for a woman with twenty thousand
pounds, and indeed could one lend out one’s liking upon
land security, I think one might very well settle it upon
him. To laugh at a poor man is barbarous. He is a
great friend of the family I am with, and I fear will
come often; and in spite of his respectable manors and
fee simple, and ancient mansion, both great and good,
I shall not be able to give a serious attention to his
discourse.</p>

<p>“I wish you could see my habitation, a right reverend
and venerable one it is; the staircase that leads to my
chamber is hung with the funeral escutcheons of my
grandfathers, grandmothers, Aunts and Uncles, that I
seem to be entering the burying vault of the family to
sleep with my Fathers. It is a comfort, no doubt, to
think one’s ancestors have had Christian burial, but
of what use are these tawdry escutcheons? Sure no
passion of the mind, no situation of the human creature
is without vanity, if the mourner can adorn with pomp,
and the breathless carcase be dressed in it.</p>

of Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149">[149]</a> Mrs. Secker and Miss Talbot,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150">[150]</a> and they
seemed to think Dr. Middleton was not so much the
historian as the Panegyrist of Cicero, indeed one
observation I have already made myself, I think him
too like a modern Lawyer who pleads all causes good or
bad that gets him interest which was money to them;
but when I have read the whole I will read St. Real
again, and then I will tell you more of my mind. I long
till you read Horace, and think he would be particularly
proper in your present retirement, he seems to know
how to amuse himself in such a scene better than any
one I ever met with, at the same time that he was the
delight of the politest court<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151">[151]</a> that ever was. I really
think you have much of the genius of distinguishing
right from wrong, and not being led away by the false
glosses of the world, and want to know whether you
find that conformity.</p>

<p>“I told you in my last I wished to spend some time
with you in your banishment. I am so sincere in it,
that if you were in a place where they are not above
being paid for my lodging and board, I would come to
you for one fortnight before you go home....</p>

<p>“My Mother desires her compliments to you, and
many thanks for remembering the cowslips. The
manner of saving them is this only, pulling them out
of the Pod, and letting them dry in a north window,
and when they are dry, to put them up in a paper
bag.</p>

made me very happy. If my friends at a distance did
not keep my affections awake, I should be lulled into a
state of insensibility, divided as I am from all I love....
What’s Cicero to me or I to Cicero? as Hamlet would
say; and for myself, though this same little, insignificant
self be very dear unto me, yet I have not used to make
it my sole object of love and delight....</p>

<p>“I want just such a companion as you would be, and
how happy would your kind compliance with that wish
make me, if the good old folk here would accommodate
you; but they are so fearful of strangers, I know it
impossible to persuade them to it. They are not very
fine people; they have a little estate, and help it out
with a little farming: are very busy and careful, and the
old man’s cautionness has dwindled into penuriousness,
so that he eats in fear of waste and riot, sleeps with the
dread of thieves, denies himself everything for fear of
wanting anything, riches give him no plenty, increase
no joy, prosperity no ease: he has the curse of covetousness
to want the property of his neighbours, while he
dare not touch his own: the Harpy Avarice drives him
from his own meat, the sum of his wisdom and his gains
will be by living poor, to die rich....</p>

Horace does me great honour.... Upon your recommendation

What hopes our relation may have of settling the affections

</div>

<p>The letter is signed “M. R. M.,” for Matthew Robinson

had been some help to their economy, but when people
have not enough for the necessaries of life, what avails
it that they can do without the superfluities and pomps

Lumley. She was much in love with him, but from
smallness of means on either side, deemed marriage
imprudent. She, however, had a desperate illness, and
informed Sterne she had made him her heir. His gratitude
for this, and affection, recalled her to life and
matrimony. For details of this I must refer the reader

they are, upon you: j’am not sure if vanity, as well as ye

<div class="sidenote">MATTHEW ROBINSON —<br>
A BROTHER’S ADMIRATION</div>

<p>On April 27 occurs a most brotherly letter from
Matthew from Bath. It is too long to place here in full,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
but so beautiful are his words to his sister, showing
his love and admiration for her, that I give a few
extracts. He had just received a letter of her’s which
pleased him, and says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should be ashamed after so long a friendship with
you to be ignorant of any of your talents, yet I do
assure you there are some of them that after so long an
accquaintance with them, I have not yet done admiring.
It is never without great delight that I see in one whom
I esteem so much, that tho’ in company one would swear
your parts and spirits were contrived purposely for
laughter, and the chearful round of mirth, yet study and
thought, contemplation of the ways of men, or works of
Nature, and consequently enjoyment of yourself, and
ease and happiness, the end of all good, never desert
your leisure and retirement. You never had greater
reason for this turn of mind, or better trial of your
temper on that account than lately, when driven from
your friends, and almost alone, in a manner you never
were before, and probably may never be again: you
were fairly left to the food and entertainment of your
own thoughts; and though it would be impertinent
now to mention my general opinion of your letters, I
don’t remember that I ever saw your thoughts stamped
upon a piece of paper with greater force of discernment
than in the letter I received from you to-day.... Bating
the tribe of your lovers, you cannot have a more hearty
friend to your person, or more assured admirer of your
merit and accomplishments.”</p>
</div>

<p>Surely few brothers have ever paid a more graceful
tribute of praise to a sister! Matthew was born in 1713,
and was consequently seven years older than Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SMALLPOX</div>

<p>On May 9, in a letter to Mr. Freind, we learn the two
sisters had met again—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had the joy of seeing my dear Pea yesterday; I
cannot express the happiness of such a meeting, but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
saying enough to own it more than recompensed the
pangs of parting. It is truly, as well as poetically said,
‘The heart can ne’er a transport know, that never felt a
pain.’ My desire to be cheered again by that beloved
voice made me desirous of a meeting much sooner than
I should be otherwise, in my shameful fear of the distemper,
have desired. We talked about an hour in the
open air, at about two yards’ distance: she kept her hat
so close I could not see her face, but as soon as it has
nothing left of the distemper, but the redness, I am to
see her. I am now within sight of our house at a farm
just at the bottom of the gates. I have a very good room,
warm and comfortable. It is so low that it flatters my
pride by indulging me with an approach to the ceiling.
My Mamma had sent furniture for the room from Mount
Morris, as soon as my sister was growing better, that I
might come so near as to be accustomed to the family,
and so return to it at leisure without any apprehensions.”</p>
</div>

<p>Reproaching Mr. Freind for silence in this letter, he
writes, May 19, in return to plead his parochial duties,

<p>At this period Elizabeth developed a most painful
weakness of the eyes, which recurred at intervals during
the rest of her life. She attributed it to reading so much
at night during her absence from home while her sister
was ill. The duchess writes to implore her not to work,
or read, and she answers, “I follow your grace’s advice,
I do not work at all, and I read by my sister’s eyes.”
She had commenced dining at Mount Morris, but they
would not let her go upstairs for fear of infection, so
she still slept at the farm. Mr. Freind had in his last
letter said, “Let us know all about you; when you set
sail, <i>i.e.</i> when you are to be manned, and who is to be
your Captain, for these things surely must be settled
now.” To which she answers—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not going to set sail yet; the ocean of fortune
is rough, the bark of fortune light, the prosperous gale
uncertain, but the Pilot must be smooth, steady and
content, patient in storms, moderate and careful in sunshine,
and easy in the turns of the wind, and changes of
the times. Guess if these things be easily found? and
without such a guide can I avoid the gulph of misfortune,
the barking of envy, the deceits of the syrens, and the
hypocrisy of Proteus? So I wait on the shore, scarce
looking towards this land of promise, so few I find with
whom I would risk the voyage. I would have wrote you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>a longer letter, if I had a frank, but careful of your
sixpence, though regardless of your leisure, that consideration
hinders me. I am at Mount Morris again.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">“LIFE OF CICERO”</div>

<p>The duchess having commenced reading <cite>Dr. Conyers
Middleton’s “Life of Cicero,”</cite> Elizabeth recommends a
pamphlet called <cite>“Observations on Cicero,” written by
Mr. Lyttelton</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165">[165]</a> but without his name being prefixed to
it. She states, “Dr. Middleton compliments it in his
preface slightly; it is as much a criticism as the Doctor’s
is a panegyric of Tully’s action: it is a very little book,
but I think wrote with great spirit and elegance.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Fidget</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“You will be much surprised to receive so
melancholy a letter from me after that strange medley
you had last post, but yesterday morning I was told the
Doctor had no hopes of my Papa; he hurt his leg some
time ago, and Sergeant Dickens has had it in hand, and
declared to Dr. Mead<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166">[166]</a> he would go on no longer without
another surgeon was called in, upon which Skipton
was sent for, and what will be the result of their consultations
to-day I dread to know; he has besides a
jaundice and dropsy. He was out Friday night, and
pretty well of Saturday night, and grew so much worse
yesterday morning that he is not able to move. The
Doctor was surprised to find such an alteration in a few
hours. Oh! my dear Fidget, ’tis not possible to flatter
oneself, God only knows what is best for us, therefore
I am sensible I ought to be contented with what He is
pleased to inflict upon us, but I cannot help my natural

show the least regret at leaving this troublesome world,
except when he took leave of me, and that was too
moving a scene for me even to tell now.” ...</p>
</div>

<p>At the end she begs Elizabeth not to write to her, as
her eyes were so bad, but to get Sarah to do so instead,
and in all her trouble remembers to send two bottles
of arquebusade to Matthew Robinson’s chambers which
he wanted, the price being 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bottle.</p>

<p>Edward, 2nd Earl of Oxford, was the son of Robert,
1st Earl, by his first marriage with Elizabeth Foley,
sister of Thomas, 1st Lord Foley; he continued to
collect the Harleian <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168">[168]</a> begun by his father, now in
the British Museum, also innumerable books, pictures,

studies, as did his countess.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

</div>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth wrote to condole heartily with the duchess
on her sad loss, but imploring her, for the sake of the
duke and her dear little children, to endeavour to bear
up under this sad blow, for father and daughter were
tenderly attached to each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ONE-HORSE CHAISE</div>

<p>The universal panacea of bleeding—for one can only
judge by the manner in which doctors applied to it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
every case—had been endured by Elizabeth for the sake
of her eyes, and she says “my eyes are worse for the
bleeding.” She had a narrow escape at this time: her
brother Matthew driving her for her health along the
seashore on a high bank raised to keep off the incursion
of the sea, the horse bolted, but fortunately their servant
outrider was able to stop it without its bolting down
either side of the bank. It is characteristic of the times
that she calls a one-horse chaise, “of all things the most
ridiculous!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan had been ill, and was ordered to
Tunbridge Wells, to drink the waters. There was hope
of Dr. Young being there. “I believe you will find his
thoughts little confined to the place; he will entertain
you with conversation much above what one generally
finds there, where they talk of little but water, bread,
butter, and scandal.”</p>

<p>On July 5 the duchess writes to say they had
carried their cause in the law suit. She also expresses
her joy at hearing Matthew Robinson intended to be
inoculated that autumn. Elizabeth said if her eyes and
general health were better, she would be inoculated too.
She had just been given, “by a wise son of Æsculapius,
a diabolical bolus that half killed me. I fainted away
about three hours after I swallowed the notable composition,
and was above an hour in such agony that if
I had not waited for your letter I had certainly gone to
the Elysian fields.”</p>

<p>A letter of Mrs. Botham’s from Elford, of which
place, as well as of Yoxall, Staffordshire, her husband
was Vicar, mentions a legacy left to her and her sister,
Mrs. Laurence Sterne—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My husband is in the North; his journey thither
happened very opportunely, for an ancient woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>whose very name I am a stranger to, has lately dyed
intestate, and my Sister and self are heirs at law of her
real estate, which consists of some houses at Leeds, the
yearly value of them about £60. It would be well for
us if we could make out a title to her personal estate,
which is upwards of £5000, but that I have no hopes of.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A WINDSOR HATTER</div>

<p>The duke and duchess were now at Bullstrode, and
anxious for Elizabeth to come to them. The duchess
gives an amusing account of a hatter’s funeral—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A hatter of Windsor left £100 to a man on condition

<p>Mrs. Donnellan writes on September 1 to say she
has returned from Tunbridge Wells after a six weeks’
visit; staying with her married sister, Mrs. Clayton, and
her husband, Robert Clayton, Bishop of Killala, and
afterwards of Clogher. The bishop very nobly gave
his wife’s paternal fortune to her sister, Anne Donnellan.
Dr. Young was at Tunbridge, and Mrs. Donnellan
states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I conversed much with Doctor Young, but I had not
enough to satisfy me. We ran through many subjects,
and I think his conversation much to my taste. He
enters into human nature, and both his thoughts and
expressions are new.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCOTTS OF SCOTT’S HALL</div>

<p>She also mentions that Lady Thanet, accompanied
by Mrs. Scott, was at Tunbridge. Mrs. Scott,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171">[171]</a> of Scott’s
Hall, Kent, was a friend of the Robinsons. She had a
large family, seven sons and seven daughters; one was
lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Orange, and married
a Monsieur Saumaize, a member of the suite. Her sister
Caroline, or “Cally Scott” (her pet-name), was the
bosom friend of Sarah Robinson, and eventually married
a Mr. Best. Another, Cecilia, who died unmarried, was
a friend to the Robinson family for life. To Mrs.
Donnellan Elizabeth writes on September 13, and in a
long letter she says—</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171" title="Return to text.">[171]</a> The Scotts of Scott’s Hall were one of the most ancient

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The time for my brother’s inoculation draws near,
and though I have a very good opinion of that method
of having the smallpox, yet I cannot enjoy a perfect
tranquillity of mind till it is over. I would fain persuade
him to have it done while I am in the country, but he
will not grant my request; for my Pappa, I believe, will
not let me go to Bullstrode at all, if I don’t go before
that is over; and my brother therefore waits for my
departure, that I may not be banished for six weeks or
two months, which he imagines would be melancholy
for me these long evenings, as I should have no friend
with me, and am not able to divert myself with books
now my eyes are bad.”</p>
</div>

<p>The duchess was waiting for Lady Oxford’s departure
from Bullstrode. Lady Oxford is often alluded to
as “the Speaker” by the duchess, the same name, as
has been mentioned, was bestowed on Mrs. Robinson
by her children. Elizabeth’s health being so indifferent,
her parents wished her to consult Dr. Mead, and early
in October she proceeded to London with her brother
Tom, where she stayed a few days with Mrs. Donnellan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in Bond Street, and on October 13 joined her beloved
friends at Bullstrode, the duchess sending her coach to
London to fetch her.</p>

<p>Matthew was to be inoculated as soon as the coach
returned to Mount Morris from taking Elizabeth to
town, as, till the smallpox appeared, he was to take the
air daily in it; but the inoculation did not take, and
Elizabeth’s tender fears for her brother were allayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE OF LORD SANDWICH</div>

<p>The next letter of interest is on October 20, to her
mother—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I return you many thanks for your directions for
the apron, which I will carefully follow; as to the silver
thread I do not approve the use of it, as all great artists
work for immortality, and my sister will find a little
time will tarnish her work if there is a mixture of silver
in it.... I honour Lord Sandwich<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172">[172]</a> for his wise and
generous contempt of money in a point in which there
are other things superior to it; he bears an excellent
character, there is much prudence in knowing how to
separate one’s particular happiness from that which is
reckoned so in the world’s opinion: if Lord Sandwich
takes greater pleasure in the conversation of a fine
woman than in viewing a collection of medals and
pictures, he is right to prefer Miss Dolly Fane with
£5000 to Miss Spinckes with £50,000.... He has a good
estate sufficient for the becoming state of a nobleman....
Miss Fane is a happy woman to have a lover so great,
so generous, and so good. Love has a good right over
the marriages of men, but not of women; for men raise
their wives to their ranks, women stoop to their
husbands, if they choose below themselves. I think all
our neighbours are in a marrying humour. I wish
some of them had married two and twenty years ago, we
should have had now a gallant young neighbourhood.”</p>

should we think of a blister applied to the back to reduce
a swelled lip in these days? Yet it was ordered!
Writing to Sarah, she says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am better than I was, but my mouth not being
yet perfectly reduced, I have got a fresh blister upon
my back, well may it bend with such a weight of

on Sunday night shall take a souze. I think it a pleasant
remedy. I am to sit a quarter of an hour in the bath,
and then go to bed and lye warm; it is to be repeated
three times a week.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUCAL BATHS!</div>

<p>The next letter to her mother throws a curious light
on the personal cleanliness of the day, and the want of
baths in a ducal house—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“November 6, 1741.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I should write to you much oftener, if I was
able, but really I am so taken up with the pursuit of
health I have little time for other employments. My
lip is not entirely reduced, though I have been blistered
twice, once blooded, and have five times taken physick,
have lived upon chicken and white meats, and drank
nothing but water; however, I am now vastly better
than I was, and have hardly any pimples in my face,
and no complaint in my eyes or nose, only this abominable
lip is still rather bigger than it used to be. I
intend to keep the blister going till it is well, for Mr.
Clarke has put me in a way of doing it, so that I do not
suffer much. I have suffered great disappointment
about the warm bath, which I am advised to try, for the
bathing tubs are so out of order we have not yet been
able to make them hold water, but I hope next week
they will serve the purpose.” ...</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>
<p>At the end of the letter is this: “Mary brings me
word my bathing tub<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173">[173]</a> is ready for use; so to-morrow
I shall go in. Pray look for my bathing dress, till then
I must go in in chemise and jupon!” Evidently from

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW LADY’S-MAID —<br>
A MICROSCOPE</div>

<p>Another light on domestic service of the day is given
in the next letter to Sarah. For some reason Elizabeth
had a new lady’s-maid, and it appears from this and
other letters that a superior class of persons officiated
in that capacity. Many a clergyman’s daughter was
glad to be lady’s-maid or housekeeper in those days—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p id="dufour">“I like my maid extreamly; she is very humble,

Dufour had about £1600 for her fortune, but by the
knavery of a partner in their trade, they were reduced.
I think Mary works pretty quick, and washes well, and
is very handy, and she talks much better French than
Dulac.</p>

<p>“I am reading <cite>Dr. Swift’s and Mr. Pope’s letters</cite>. I like
them much, and find great marks of friendship, goodness
and affection between these people whom the world is
apt to think too wise to be honest, and too witty to be
affectionate, but vice is the child of folly, rather than

for the first there is nothing of speculation, either in the
Terra Firma of Reason, or the Visionary province of
fancy, into which he does not lead the imagination. In
his conversation he examines everything, determines
hardly anything, but leaves one’s judgment at liberty.
The other goes far into a subject, and seldom leaves the
conclusion of an argument unfinished; he seems to me
to have a very accurate judgment, and a very attentive
observation of everything that comes within his view,
and thus with the assistance of a happy memory, he has
laid up a great stock of knowledge and experience.”</p>

I am, I fear, neither better nor richer than it found me,

I rate highly, that it has ensured you from the danger

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Donnellan</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Though there is no day of the year in which
one does not wish all happiness to one’s friends, this is
the particular day in which the heart goes forth in
particular vows and wishes for the welfare of those it
loves. It is the birth of a new year, whose entrance we
would salute, and hope auspicious; nor is this particular
mark of time of little use: it teaches us to number our
days, which a wise man thought an incitement to the
well spending them; and, indeed, did we consider how
much the pleasure and profit of our lives depends upon
an economy of our time, we should not waste it as we
do, in idle repentance, or reflection on the past, or a vain
unuseful regard for the future. In youth we defer being
prudent till we are old, and look forward to a promise
of wisdom as the portion of latter years: when we are
old we seek not to improve, and scarce employ ourselves;
looking backward to our youth as to the day of
our diligence, and take a pride in laziness, saying we
rest as after the accomplishment of our undertakings;
but we ought to ask for our daily merit, as for our
daily bread. The mind, no more than the body, can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>sustained by the food taken yesterday, or promised for
to-morrow. Every day ought to be considered as a
period apart, some virtue should be exercised, some
knowledge improved, and the value of happiness well
understood, some pleasure comprehended in it; some
duty to ourselves or others must be infringed if any of
these things are neglected....</p>

<p>“I beg of you to reserve Monday morning for me, and
I will spend it all with you; on Tuesday I set out for
Mount Morris, and on Sunday night Pen<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198">[198]</a> desires you

of it with gratitude, and not with regret, and thank Fate

<p>“When I arrived at Northfleet, where we dined,
every Phillis and Corydon were at a fair in the town,
and to enter into the humours of the place, I walked
through it. In one booth were nymphs and swains
buying garters, with amorous posies, some only with
the humble request, ‘When these you see, remember
me’; others with a poetical and more familiar ‘Be true
to me, as I’m to thee.’ Under another booth, for the
pleasure of bold British youths, was Admiral Vernon in
gingerbread; indeed he appeared in many shapes there,
and the curate of the parish carried him home in a brass
tobacco stopper. I was a little concerned to see him
lying in passive gingerbread, upon a stall with Spanish
nuts; but the politicians of our age are wonderful in
reconciling the interest of nations. I assure you there
was a great deal of company; many hearts did I see
exchanged for fairings of cherry-coloured ribbon; and
one Cymon more polished than the rest, presented his
damsel with a fan, with the intent, I presume, not to
give ‘coolness to the matchless Dame.’”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Clarges Street, February 9, 1742.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Robinson will think me very dilatory
in obeying her commands, but the uneasy situation I
have been in, surrounded by sick friends<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205">[205]</a> and servants,
must make an excuse for me.</p>

<p>“Burnet,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206">[206]</a> I hope is safe on your table, and has by
this time given you some entertainment.</p>

<p>“As for the fringe it should have been sent to you
sooner, could I have found it, but it was buried under
such a variety of rubbish it was like digging in a mine
to find it. Don’t let these delays discourage you from
making use of me again, for no one can take more
pleasure in being your humble servant than I do. This
is asserting a bold truth, and would draw on me numbers
of challenges, if I published it. I should not be afraid
of accepting the combat where my cause was so good.
Our letters crost on the road. Your observation on
retirement is very just, and all your thoughts show the
good use you make of Retirement; but I wish for my
own sake to draw you out of it. I am not so unreasonable
as to expect to hear often from you. I can’t justly
make that demand, but if you were in town I should
endeavour to have a great deal of your company; let me
know when I may hope to see you. At present I can
give you no very inviting reason for coming; as to the
entertainments of the place, all parties are out of humour;
everybody conjectures something; nobody knows anything,
but that Sir R(obert) W(alpole) kissed hands
yesterday as Lord Orford, and his daughter as Lady
Mary, that he resigned yesterday, and goes to Houghton
in a few days. His faithful services to his King are well
rewarded. I have been interrupted by two favourites
of yours, Lord Cornbury and Mrs. Donnellan, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
recommend them still stronger to your favour, they have
prevented your having a dull long letter. I send the
fringe enclosed; if I wait till my spirit is more alert you
may want your apron, and think I have quite neglected
your orders. I will run any hazard rather than give
you just cause to complain of me, and am with great
sincerity,</p>

writes this interesting letter to her father in Kent—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I thought it would be agreeable to you to have
an account of the mighty and important proceedings of
both houses yesterday, so I have sent you the question,
which was debated in both Houses with a good deal of
warmth. It was brought into the House of Lords by
Lord Carteret,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218">[218]</a> who spoke two hours in opening. Lord
Carlisle and Lord Westmorland spoke with great
warmth, and Lord Carlisle<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219">[219]</a> was very bitter. Lord
Halifax<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220">[220]</a> seconded Lord Carteret. Lord Talbot said in
answer to the Duke of Marlborough’s motion (that it
might be voted that an attempt to inflict any kind of
punishment, etc., etc.) that he would not say that all
persons were interested that spoke in favour of Sir
Robert, that they appeared to be so, and upon being
called to order, he said with heat that he was used to
speak truth, and he did believe (by the most sacred
oath) that they were so, and that he was ready to give
any man satisfaction that would require it. All moderate
men voted with the majority in both Houses. Lord
Cornbury and Mr. Harley spoke in favour of Sir R.:
the latter said that though Sir R. had pursued a relation<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221">[221]</a>
of his without evidence, and caused his imprisonment,
and thereby the shortening of his life, he could not, as
he had differed from him in all his measures, copy him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in that, and so withdrew with his brother and many
others who had great disobligations to the Member.
Mr. Skipper would not vote against the great man, for
it seems there was no proof nor evidence of the accusations.
I think the majority was 290 against 190 in the
House of Commons. Many of the Country interest did
not vote at all; they did not break up till three. The
House of Lords at one o’clock in the morning. Mr.
Sandys<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222">[222]</a> opened very well, and Mr. ‘Ste’-Fox<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223">[223]</a> spoke on
the other side extremely well. I may by the next post,

this is all I have yet heard, for the Members of Parliament

GARRICK</div>

<p>Elizabeth, in a letter to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind,
gives us an insight into the Opera of that period—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was at the Opera on Saturday night, where was
all the world. I was very well diverted between the
Opera and the Audience, or I ought rather to say the
Spectators, for they came to see and not to hear. I
heard the Elephant was the finest thing in the Opera,
but that was contradicted, and the burning of the
Temple was preferred to it. To accommodate everything
to the absurdity of the Town, the dancing is
rendered more ridiculous and grotesque than ever.
I was thinking if the Court of Augustus could have seen
the polite part of our nation, admiring a wooden
Elephant, with two lamps stuck for eyes, and poor
Scipio and Asdrubal could have risen to have seen
themselves covered with silver spangles, and quavering
an Italian Air, what an honest indignation and scorn
would they have conceived at us....</p>

<p>“My Sister Pea is abroad; I am confined again by a
little feverishness. I thought as it was a London fever
it might be polite, so I carried it to the Ridotto, Court,
and Opera, but it grew so perverse and stubborn, so I
put it into a White Hood and double handkerchief, and
kept it by the fire these three days, and it is better;
indeed I hope it is worn out. On Saturday I intend to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>go to Goodman’s Fields to see Garrick<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224">[224]</a> act Richard

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> made but few allusions to Elizabeth’s love
triumphs, but as the time approaches when she was to
make her final choice, I must now allude to them.
There was a certain “Mr. B.,” from what I can gather
a Mr. Brockman, of Beechborough, a fine place near
Mount Morris, who had been desperately in love with
her for some time; he is frequently alluded to in the
family letters. In one to Sarah at this period Elizabeth
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Poor Mr. B. really takes his misfortunes so to heart
that he is literally dying, indeed I hear he is very ill,
which I am sorry for, but I have no balsam of heartsease
for him, if he should die I will have him buried in
Westminster Abbey next the woman that died of a
prick of a finger, for it is quite as extraordinary, and he
shall have his figure languishing in wax, with ‘Miss
Robinson, fecit,’ wrote over his head; upon my word I
compassionate his pains, and pity him, but as I am as
compassionate, I am as cold too as Charity. He pours
out his soul in lamentations to his friends, and ‘all but
the nymph that should redress his wrong, attend his
passion and approve his song,’ for the Rhyme will
have it so. I am glad he has such a stock of flesh to
waste upon. Waller says that—</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVERS</div>

<p>A certain captain, name unknown, also inveigled the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind to a coffee-house to talk two hours
by the clock of Miss Elizabeth Robinson’s perfections.
About this Elizabeth writes to Mr. Freind—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am very sorry if the poor man is really what you
think, unhappy; if his case is uneasy I am sure it is
desperate; complaint I hope, is more the language, than
misery the condition, of lovers. To speak ingenuously
you men use us oddly enough, you adore the pride,
flatter the vanity, gratify the ill-nature, and obey the
tyranny that insults you; then slight the love, despise
the affection, and enslave the obedience that would
make you happy: when frowning mistresses all are
awful goddesses, when submissive wives, despicable
mortals. There are two excellent lines which have
made me ever deaf to the voice of the charmer, charm’d
he ever so sweetly—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry-etc">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentqq">“‘The humblest Lover when he lowest lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Submits to conquer, and but kneels to rise.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Flattery has ever been the ladder to power, and I
have detested its inverted effects of worshipping one into
slavery, while it has pretended to adore one to Deification.
If ever I commit my happiness to the hands of
any person, it must be one whose indulgence I can
trust, for flattery I cannot believe. I am sure I have
faults, and am convinced a husband will find them, but
wish he may forgive them; but vanity is apt to seek the
admirer, rather than the friend, not considering that the
passion of love may, but the effect of esteem can never,
degenerate to dislike. I do not mean to exclude Love,
but I mean to guard against the fondness that arises
from personal advantages.... I have known many
men see all the cardinal virtues in a good complexion,
and every ornament of a character in a pair of fine eyes,
and they have married these perfections, which might
perhaps shine and bloom a twelvemonth, and then alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
it appeared these fine characters were only written in
white and red.</p>

<p>“A long and intimate acquaintance is the best presage
of future agreement. I have strengthened this argument
to myself by the example of you and Mrs. Freind.
I hope in my long and tedious dissertation I have said
nothing disrespectful of Love. As for your particular
inducement to it I cannot tell whether it was beauty or
good qualities, they being united in her in a degree of
perfection not to be excelled.”</p>
</div>

<p>After wishing the rejected lover “Riches and alliance
to help his laudable ambition,” she concludes with, “I
wish the same advantages for myself, with one of established
fortune and character, so established, that one
piece of generosity should not hurt his fortune, nor one
act of indiscretion prejudice his character.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR GEORGE LYTTELTON</div>

<p>Who this particular individual was is not now known,
but that Elizabeth was the cynosure of all eyes from
her wit, beauty, and vivacity is shown by her brothers’
letters of this period, which constantly allude to her
troop of admirers. Mr. Lyttelton, now Sir George
Lyttelton, the only single man whom she had ever
mentioned with uniform admiration, married this year,
on June 15, Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq.,
of Filleigh, Devonshire, a marriage of the purest affection
on both sides.</p>

<p>In a letter at the end of 1741 she states that her
father’s steward in Yorkshire had been guilty of peccadilloes,
and that she was to accompany her parents to
Yorkshire in early spring, where her father promised
her attendance at the York races, in lieu of the Canterbury
ones, which then appeared to her a poor substitute.
Whilst in Yorkshire she either met for the first time,
or more probably renewed her acquaintance with, Mr.
Edward Montagu, her future husband, of whom some
account must now be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. EDWARD MONTAGU</div>

<p>Edward Montagu was the son of Charles Montagu,
fifth son of the great Earl of Sandwich,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226">[226]</a> Lord High
Admiral of the Fleet to Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and who had acted
as his proxy at his marriage with Catherine of Braganza.
Charles Montagu married twice. By his first wife,
Elizabeth Foster, he had one son, James; he married
for second wife Sarah Rogers, daughter of John Rogers
and his wife, <i>née</i> Margaret Cock. The Rogers owned
large estates at Newcastle-on-Tyne<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227">[227]</a> and in its neighbourhood.
Charles Montagu, by his second marriage,
had three sons, Edward, Crewe, and John, and a daughter,
Jemima, who was married at the time I am writing of
to Mr. Sydney Medows, afterwards Sir Sydney Medows.
Mr. Edward Montagu was born in 1691, hence he was
twenty-nine years older than Elizabeth. At the time he
courted Elizabeth, another admirer, a young nobleman,
whose name I know not, is stated to have been in love
with her, but constant to her former protestation of
choosing a “formed character” that she could look up to,
she chose the older man. It is odd not a sentence is met
with about him before, except that one of her brothers
chaffs her about “converting a Mr. M—— to dancing,”
which may have referred to him. He was a profound
mathematician, the friend of Emerson and other learned
men of that day. His character was amiable, equable, just,
and of the highest integrity, as is shown by his letters,
and his political conduct as a Member of Parliament in
what was a corrupt age. Mrs. Carter<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228">[228]</a> mentions him
“as a man of sense, a scholar, and a mathematician” in
her letters. He owned a good estate at Allerthorpe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Yorkshire, and another near Rokeby (the fine estate
belonging to Elizabeth’s cousin, “Long” Sir Thomas
Robinson), also a house in Dover Street, London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. DONNELLAN’S ADVICE —<br>
SWIFT’S YAHOOS</div>

<p>Evidently the letter here inserted in Mrs. Anne
Donnellan’s handwriting, but unsigned, was an answer
to an appeal of Elizabeth’s for advice as to this courtship.
Though long, I consider it so perfectly suitable in its
advice to any persons contemplating matrimony, I give
it <i>in extenso</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can’t enough express to you, my dear Friend, how
much your confidence in me obliges me, as it shows me
the place I hold in your heart. The latter part of your
letter, which is what I write to now, is a difficulty I
know how to pity, as I have experienced it, and yet I do
not find I am at all the more capable of advising how to
avoid it; there is a medium between encouragement and
ill humour that is certainly right to avoid being thought
to desire to raise a passion that one does not design to
gratifie, or to be too apt to think one has raised a
passion that must be discouraged, for as I think nothing
is more unjust than to wish to make another unhappy,
merely to gratifie a vanity of being known to be admired,
so nothing is more ridiculous than to be too apt to fancy
one has raised such a passion, and I should always
choose to be the last that perceived it, rather than the
first. I have seen so many appearances of liking that
has proved neither uneasy to one side or t’other, that I
am not apt to fear great hurt from them, and I fancy the
longer you live the more you will be of my mind;
indeed when a man gives way to a passion on a prospect
of success, and finds a disappointment to it, has often, I
believe, given a melancholy turn to his whole life: but
for what I call occasional likings they can run from one
to another with great ease and dexterity. Now what I
think the most difficult in these affairs is to satisfie
others in our conduct, for there is as you observe, in the
heart of male and female a principle of vanity and self-love
that makes us unwillingly give way to a preference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>in any thing, and we are very apt to comfort ourselves
with thinking, and sometimes saying, that the preference
given is not from greater perfections, but from greater
encouragement, ‘some people set themselves out, and
pay a court I cannot,’ when we are all doing our best to
gain this descried admiration, and vexed, even to make
us unjust when we fail. In short, and when I view
human nature in some lights, I can almost forgive
Swift’s Yahoos. But to the point. I should think the
behaviour on these occasions should be as easy as we
can, and we should be pretty sure there is a passion
growing in the heart before we make an alteration that
can be perceived by the person concerned, and as for
the by-slanderers, I should endeavour to convince them
I did not desire such a conquest, but at the same time,
I would not let them think they could easily persuade
me I had made it. I would converse as usual in public,
but I would avoid private conversations, lest others
should think I sought them, but these are things I am
sure you can think of better than I can, and must be
practised as circumstances suit. The person said nothing
here but what was extremely proper, we talked of you
all, and you and another were commended with great
elegance, and for the third they said they did not know
them enough to give an opinion.</p>

<p>“Now my dear Friend a word about the desire that
is natural in most females to make lovers, if you meet
with a person who you think would be proper to make
you happy in the married state, and they show a desire
to please you, and a solidity in their liking, give it the
proper encouragement that the decency of our sex will
allow of, for it is the settlement in the world we should
aim at, and the only way we females have of making
ourselves of use to Society and raising ourselves in this
world; but for lovers merely for being courted and
admired they are of no real use, and often prove a great
detriment both by their own malice of disappointment
and their jealousy of others, and for a friendship of any
tenderness between disengaged persons of different sexes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
I am afraid there is no such thing, so do not be caught
by that deceitful bait. Esteem and regard may be without
passion, but tenderness and confidence, and what
we call friendship among ourselves, will, with opportunity,
turn to desire in the different sexes. We desire
to possess a friend to know their heart, to be in their
thoughts, this must turn to passion between the sexes,
I think ’tis impossible to be otherwise, and I could
express it more philosophically but you will do it for
me. Now pardon me this impertinent letter, there are
not those in the world to whom I would write so freely,
for I do not know those who I think have sense and
goodness of heart, to bear advice: the only merit of
mine is its sincerity and affection, and having seen more
years has given me many opportunities of seeing the
world of love, with all its mischiefs. Adieu, burn this,
and love me as I do you most sincerely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. MONTAGU’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Anyhow, Mr. Montagu and Elizabeth entered into an
engagement, and in the <cite><i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i></cite> for August,
1742, is the following announcement:—“August 5th.
Edward Montagu, Esqr., Member for Huntingdon, to
the eldest daughter of Matthew Robinson, of Horton in
Kent, Esqr.”</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind tied the nuptial knot.</p>

<p>The day after her marriage Mrs. Montagu writes to

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Friday, August 6, 1742.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I return your Grace a thousand thanks for
your letter; the good wishes of a friend are of themselves
a happiness, and believe me I have always thought
myself the nearer being happy because I knew you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
wished me so. If your affection to me will last as long
as my love and gratitude towards you, I think it will
stay with me till the latest moment I shall have in this
world; no alteration of circumstances or length of time
can wear out my grateful remembrance of your favours
to me; you have a station in my heart, from whence
you cannot be driven while any one virtue lives in it:
truth, constancy, gratitude, and every honest affection
guard you there!</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu desires me to make his compliments
to my Lord Duke and your Grace, with many thanks
for the favour his Grace designs him of a visit which he
is not willing to put off so long as our return from
Yorkshire, but will be glad of the honour of seeing the
Duke on Monday, at seven o’clock in Dover Street; and
I hope at that most happy hour to have the pleasure of
seeing you. We shall spend that evening in Town. If
you will be at home to-morrow at two o’clock, I will
pass an hour with you; but pray send me word to
Jermyn Street at eleven, whether I can come to you
without meeting any person at Whitehall but the Duke;
to every one else pray deny your dressing room. Mr.
Freind will tell your Grace I behaved magnanimously,
and not one cowardly tear, I assure you, did I shed at
the solemn Altar, my mind was in no mirthful mood
indeed. I have a great hope of happiness; the world,
as you say, speaks well of Mr. Montagu, and I have
many obligations to him, which must gain my particular

the joyful occasion of your marriage if I had known
whither to address them; for your brother’s letter which
informed me, happened to lie several days at Cambridge,
before it came to my hands. My congratulation, however,
though late, wants nothing of the warmth with
which the earliest was accompanied; for I must beg
leave to assure you that I take a real part in the present
joy of your family, and feel a kind of paternal<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235">[235]</a> pleasure,
from the good fortune of one whose amiable qualities I
have been a witness of from her tenderest years, and to
whom I have ever been wishing and ominating everything
that is good. I have always expected from your
singular merit and accomplishments that they would recommend
you in proper time to an advantageous and
honourable match; and was assured from your prudence
that it would never suffer you to accept any which was
not worthy of you; so that it gives me not only the
greatest pleasure on your account, but a sort of pride also
on my own, to see my expectations so fully answered,
and my predictions of you so literally fulfilled. As all conjugal
happiness is founded on mutual affection, cherished
by good sense, so you have the fairest prospect of it now
open before you, by your marriage with a gentleman,
not only of figure and fortune, but of great knowledge
and understanding, who values you, not so much for the
charms of your person, as the beauties of your mind,
which will always give you the surest hold of him, as
they will every day be gathering strength, whilst the
others are daily losing it. But I should make a sad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
compliment to a blooming bride if I meant to exclude
her person from contributing any part to her nuptial
happiness; that is far from my meaning; and yours
Madam, I am sure, could not fail of having its full share
in acquiring your husband’s affection. What I would
inculcate therefore, is only this: that though beauty has
the greatest force to conciliate affection, yet it cannot
preserve it without the help of the mind; and whatever
the perfection of the one may be, the accomplishments
of the other will always be the more amiable; and in the
married state especially, will be found after all, the most
solid and lasting basis of domestic comfort. But I am
using the privilege of my years, and instead of compliments,
giving lessons to one who does not want them.
I shall only add, therefore, my repeated wishes for all
the joy that matrimony can give you and Mr. Montagu,
to whose worthy character I am no stranger, though I
have not the honour to be known to him in person, and
am with sincere respect,</p>

<p>“On Tuesday I arrived at this place, not tired
with my journey, but satisfied therewith. As far as
Nottingham you will travel very soon, and then as far

but not less beautiful; we came through some rivers
that charmed me beyond all things.... We have at
present very fine weather, the sun gilds every object,
and I assure you it is the only fine thing we have
here, for the house is old and not handsome: it is
very convenient, and the situation extremely pleasant.
We found the finest peaches, nectarines and apricots,
that I have ever eat: your Grace will think I mean
turnips, carrots and parsnips; but really and truly they
are apricots, peaches and nectarines. To-morrow, I
believe will be one of the happiest days I ever spent,
I am to go to fetch my brothers from school. How

gratify his bride’s love of her family, had allowed her to
have them to stay, and ever afterwards he was their
constant friend and benefactor. Further on in the letter
she states that it took them “six days with very easy
stages” to reach Allerthorpe from London! In the next
letter she states that her little brothers being “sensible,
good-natured, and sober, the most affectionate towards
each other of any children of their age I ever saw:
they have very good characters at school, both as to
their learning and behaviour; but the quintessence of

<p>On August 25 she writes to her cousin, Mrs.
Freind—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Cousin, I am ashamed I have not before
answered your kind letter and returned thanks for those
good wishes of whose accomplishments I hope there
is the fairest prospect: I think we increase in esteem
without decaying in complaisance, and I hope we shall
always remember Mr. Freind and the fifth of August
with thankfulness. I am infinitely obliged to Mr. Freind
for not letting the knot be tied by the hands of an
ordinary bungler; he was very good in coming to London
on purpose, but he did not give his last benediction, but
stole away before my sister or any of us were come
downstairs.</p>

<p>“We arrived at this place after a journey of six
days through fine countries, where the riches of Harvest
promised luxury to the Landlord, plenty to the farmer
and food to the labourer. Here we are situated in a
fine country, and Mr. Montagu has the pleasure of calling
many hundred pounds a year about his house his
own, without any person’s property interfering with it:
I think it is the prettiest estate, and in the best order I
ever saw; large and beautiful meadows for riding or
walking in, with a pretty river<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237">[237]</a> winding about them,
upon which we shall sometimes go out in boats.</p>

<p>“In this parish Dr. Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238">[238]</a> our general Uncle,
has founded a school and an Alms House where the
young are taught industry, the old, content: I propose
to visit the Alms House very soon. I saw the old
women with the Bucks upon their sleeves at Church,
and it gave me pleasure. Heraldry<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239">[239]</a> does not always
descend with such honour, as when Charity leads her by
the hand. Our uncle did this good while he was <em>alive</em>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
it was not that Soul thrift that would save itself with
another’s money.</p>

<p>“I hope you will forgive my not having written to you
before, but a new family, and a new place must take up
one’s time. Our house here is tolerably convenient, and
that is all that can be said for it. We have a better
which I hope you will often see in Berkshire.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240">[240]</a> Pray
when you and Mr. Freind have a leisure hour, dispose
of it in writing to me. Mr. Montagu has an estate near
Rokeby, from whence I intend to visit Sir Thomas

<div class="sidenote">FIRST LETTER TO MR. MONTAGU</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu having left Elizabeth for a few days
for business at Newcastle, she writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How very fortunate are those few who in the
Person they love, meet with the principles of Honour
and Virtue to guide them through the World, but this,
my fortune, so happy and so rare, shall not breed in me
that insolence of opinion that I deserve it, but I will
still look up to Heaven and you with gratitude and
continual acknowledgments.”</p>
</div>

<p>This sufficiently indicates the happiness and mutual
confidence reigning between the newly wedded pair.</p>

<p>On October 2 Dr. Conyers Middleton wrote Mrs.
Montagu a long letter, mainly a dissertation on marriage
and its duties. He alludes to his pleasure at her having
her three youngest brothers with her, calling them
“<i lang="fr">enfans trouvés</i> by a sister unknown to them,” and
he adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall always think myself particularly interested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>in their success, for they were all born under my roof,
which may, one day perhaps, derive an accession of fame
from that circumstance. If I should live to see any of
them in the University, it would be a pleasure to me to
do everything in my power that might be of use to
their improvement.”</p>
</div>

<p>This shows that Mrs. Robinson had been accustomed
to stay with her mother, the first Mrs. Middleton, for her
latter frequent confinements, though Elizabeth and some
of the elder sons were born at York. Dr. Middleton
begs Mr. and Mrs. Montagu to pay him a visit at
Cambridge on their return to London, and states, “This
university had the honour of Mr. Montagu’s education,
and claims some share in yours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PÈRE LE COURAYER —<br>
WORKSOP</div>

<p>Being detained by business in the north, Mrs.
Montagu wrote to Mrs. Donnellan to send her a
winter mantle and muff, and as prices of those times
may interest my readers, I will mention the blue
velvet mantle cost £5, the ermine muff one guinea. In
Mrs. Donnellan’s letter the Père Courayer sends his
compliments and good wishes to Mrs. Montagu. As he
figures much in later letters, I give a short sketch of his
biography. Peter Francis le Courayer was born in
1681, and was a Normandy ecclesiastic; although a
Roman Catholic, he had the courage to defend the
ordinances of the English Church, for which the Pope
censured him severely. He left France for England,
and went to Oxford, where he lodged with Mrs. Chenevix,
the famous toy-woman. He was made LL.D., and
translated <cite>Father Paul’s “History of the Council of
Trent,”</cite> also <cite>Sleidan’s “History of the Reformation.”</cite>
He was well known to Horace Walpole. He died
in 1776. His pet-name was “the little Père.” In a letter
of the duchess’s of October 9 from Welbeck, where she
was visiting her mother, Lady Oxford, she says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mamma was so obliging last week as to carry us to

are noble and grand, they have made great plantations.
The gardener told me he had planted last year 300,000
Forest trees, besides sowing three score bushels of seeds.
The approach to the house is fine. I don’t like the house
though it was built by Bess of Harwicke, whose wisdom
I have in great reverence: the best apartment is up two
pair of stairs, the additional offices lately built are
exceedingly good, the Dairy much prettier than that
we saw at Richmond. The servant told us the Duchess
gave the chief direction for the building, had planted
those woods, had drawn the plan for that piece of water
of 120 acres. The Duke’s time is chiefly occupied with
drawing plans for Bee hives! With difficulty I kept my
countenance....</p>

<p>“We were on Monday at Kiveton, which is by much
the finest house I ever saw, and the best furnished.
The Park and views from it are very beautiful.”</p>

<p>From Allerthorpe the Montagus visited Mr. Buckley<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244">[244]</a>
at Bishop’s Dale, near which place Mr. Robinson
in former days had lived in the shooting season. Elizabeth
had not been there for fifteen years. She describes
to the Duchess of Portland the country—</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_244" href="#FNanchor_244" title="Return to text.">[244]</a> Mr. Buckley had been a second father to the three little
Robinson boys, who spent their holidays with him.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had been three days upon an expedition to a wild
part of the country called the Dales, where Nature’s
works are not delicate, pretty and mignonne, but grand,
sublime and magnificent. Vast mountains, rocks and
cascades, and rapid rivers make the country beautiful
and surprising. We went to a farm abounding in
wonders, a high hill with some hanging wood before it,
behind it a large and rapid river with the prospect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
a huge cascade, an old Castle and a Church. Some
houses in view take from it the honour of absolute
solitude: a range of rocks appears like the ruins of an
old town on the other side of the river. In a cottage
built in this charming place, lives an old woman, who
has attained to an hundred and four years, and for this
long lease of life, has not exchanged the best comfort.
She enjoys good health, tolerable strength, has her
hearing perfect, and her sight very well: is cheerful and
has not lost her reason, but answers with sense and
spirit, her hair is of a fine black: she was knitting when
we went to her, and has promised to knit me a pair of
stockings in a month.</p>

<p>“My Father had a house in this part of the world for
the summer sports of shooting and fishing, so that the
old woman and I had been well acquainted 15 years ago,
and she told me laughing she imagined I did not expect
to see her alive at this time....</p>

<p>“Tell Père Courayer<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245">[245]</a> my head is as much troubled
with chimeras and giddiness as ever. I fear he is too
fond of variety in life to be a friend to Matrimony. The
merriest man I have seen in Yorkshire is a Frenchman,
who came here for religion, and has had the needful of
life added unto him; he has a little estate, and lives with
the mountain nymphs, Liberty and Health, in the
Dales; he amuses himself with singing to his grandchildren,
mending his clothes, and making soup: his
grandson eats soup with him, and his next darling, <i>le
petit chat</i>, helps him off with the Bouillie. He can not
only make a fine dish of the cabbage, but of the snails
and caterpillars, and what we call the unprofitable
vermin that live upon it! There was not a creature in
Noah’s Ark that would not be received into his larder,
for a Frenchman is seldom so proud of stomach as to
term anything unclean....</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu desires his compliments to your grace,

health as often as you can expect from sober people.

<div class="sidenote">WHIG PRINCIPLES</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu was a Whig, but, as his wife states, a
moderate one. His political conduct as Member for
Huntingdon was irreproachably upright in a most venal
age. What respect his wife already had for his judgment
is shown in a letter from her to him in London,
whither he had gone for the meeting of Parliament on
October 16, enclosing her reply to Dr. Conyers Middleton’s
letter, desiring him, if he did not approve of it,
to burn it, and she would write another. The following
passage speaks volumes for Mrs. Montagu’s humility
(though she was so universally praised):—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The letter directed to Dr. Middleton, if you
approve, I would beg the favour of you to frank, and
send to the post, but I should be glad if you would first
take the trouble to read it, for it is with some uneasiness
I correspond with the very wise. I think an
understanding of a middle size has a great deal of
trouble in conversation between reaching to those
above it, and stooping to those below it.”</p>

<p class="noindent">She signs—</p>

<div class="greetings-container">
  <div class="poetry-etc">
    <div class="verse greet0">“My Dearest, your very affectionate</div>
    <div class="verse greet3">and faithful wife.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>His letters to her begin generally “My Dearest
Angel,” or “My Dearest Life.” His writing is most
characteristic, a clear, firm hand, easily read, much
information compressed into a few words, and filled
with most affectionate expressions.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was now in an interesting condition, and
as Dr. Sandys forbade her travelling for a time, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and Sarah remained at Allerthorpe. The joy of Mr.
Montagu was extreme at the idea of an heir, which
was shared by his sister, Mrs. Medows, and all his
relations. Elizabeth, though pleased at the prospect,
was very <i>souffrante</i>, and bored by an inactive life, yet
submitted to it with a good grace.</p>

<p>At this period her brother Robert was made captain
of an East India vessel travelling to China, to his
family’s satisfaction.</p>

finer than Sir Hans Sloane’s. In particular he has a
mummy much finer preserved. It is the custom to gild
their faces, so that all the features are painted over the
gold.... Of all the things, except the pictures, which
are exquisitely fine, none pleases me more than a mask
in bronze, which is exceeding fine workmanship, and has
upon it the symbols of all the gods. The crown of vine
for Bacchus, a circle of iron for Pluto, the ears of Pan,
and the beard of waves for Neptune.”</p>

have the happiness of a correspondence with you, whose

full of sincerity and friendship, of virtue and goodness,
which you set in so true and amiable a light, that if
those that read them grow not wiser and better, it is
none of your fault.</p>

<p>“I rejoice at the good account you give of your health,
that you suffer less and less every day. I wish j could
prevent your suffering at all. The prudent care you
take obliges me in the highest degree, and j hope with
the assistance of your happy and chearful disposition of
mind, preserve you from any misfortune. Though j

content to all his dependants, and should he ever cease
to use me with more care and generosity and affection
than I deserve, I should be the first person he has ever
treated in this manner. Since I married I have never
heard him say an ill-natured word to any one, or have I
received one matrimonial frown. His generous affection
in loving all my friends, and desiring every opportunity
for my conversing with them, is very obliging to me.
We have often pleased ourselves with the hopes of
seeing you frequently in Dover Street this winter; but
alas, I am a prisoner at Allerthorpe, and the worst of
prisoners confined by infirmities and ill health.</p>

<p>“Mr. Montagu went to Parliament ten days ago to
my mortification, but with my approbation. I desired
him to go, and half wished him to stay! I knew his
righteous star would rule his destiny, so I helped him
on with honour’s boots, and let him go without murmuring.
He left me my sister, and where she is there will
happiness be also.... We have not been troubled with
any visitor since Mr. M. went away, and could you see
how ignorant, how awkward, how absurd, and how uncouth
the generality of people are in this country, you
would look upon this as a piece of good fortune....</p>

<div class="sidenote">“NIGHT THOUGHTS”</div>

<p>The Duchess of Portland, on December 4, writes in
great annoyance at some of her letters being lost. She
was much worried about the health of her mother, who
suffered severely from cramp in the stomach. She
desires Elizabeth to write a <em>visible</em><a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254">[254]</a> letter to cheer Lady
Oxford, and adds, “I rejoice you are better. I hope
you have left off footing it and tumbling downstairs.
Have you read ‘<cite>Night Thoughts</cite>’? If you have, I beg
you will give me your opinion of it.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_254" href="#FNanchor_254" title="Return to text.">[254]</a> Often the familiar letters were enclosed to Mrs. Elstob, a
learned lady and authoress, who was now governess to the Portland
children. Lady Oxford was then at Bullstrode.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Young had lost his beloved wife, his step-son
and step-daughter the year before. The step-daughter
died of consumption, brought on by grief at her mother’s
loss. Her step-father had taken her abroad for her
health. She died at Montpellier, and was refused
Christian burial by the bigoted French of those days.
The poor doctor, assisted by his servant, dug her grave
in a field, unaided by any one. Can any one wonder at
the gloom pervading the poem?</p>

<p>Whilst the duchess is writing to Mrs. Montagu, the
latter writes on December 5—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Madam, after being sunk into stupidity by the
company of a strange kind of animal called a country
Beau and wit, how unfit am I for conversation of the
Duchess of Portland!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A ROUÉ OF THE PERIOD</div>

<p>She then proceeds to draw this curious picture of a
country beau,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“who cannot attain the perfection of a monkey, even the
art of mimicry.... Had you seen the pains this animal
has been taking to imitate the cringe of a beau, the
smartness of a wit, till he was hideous to behold, and
horrible to hear, you would have pitied him! He walks
like a tortoise, and chatters like a magpye: by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>indulgence of a kind mother, and the advantage of a country
education, he was first a clown, then he was sent to the
Inns of Court, where he first fell into a red waistcoat
and velvet breeches; then into vanity. This light companion
led him to the play house, where he ostentiously
coquetted with the orange wenches, who cured him of
the bel-air of taking snuff by abridging him of his
nostrils, grown even in his own eyes no very lovely
figure; he thought Bacchus, no critic in faces, would
prove in the end a better friend than Cupid: accordingly
he fell into the company of the jovial, till want of money
and want of taste led this prodigal son, if not to eat, to
drink with swine. He visited the prisons, not as a comforter,
but as a companion to criminals; shook hands
with the gold finder, and walked in the ways of the
scavenger; so singular his humility, none were his contempt.
At last, having lost his money, ruined his constitution,
and lost all the sense nature gave him, he
returned to the country where all the youths of inferior
rank, admiring his experience, and emulating his qualities,
and copying his manners, grew, some fit for jail, others
for transportation.... Notwithstanding all these vices
and the most nauseous effect of them, all people treat
him civilly!”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu writes to his wife on December 9,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255">[255]</a> and
in it he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tomorrow the affair of the Hanover troops<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256">[256]</a> comes
on, and will be carried, which is the worst that ever
came before the House, of which j shall give you an
account in my next letter, and send you several
pamphlets well worth your reading about that, and the
present state of affairs.”</p>
</div>

<p>Writing again from his house in Dover Street,
London, on December 20, he says—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Tuesday we met at Westminster, where his
Majesty opened the session with a most gracious speech
from the throne, which j hope you have got, as you shall
have the addresses of both Houses sent by this post.
You will easily perceive what was aimed at by the
speech, and that by the addresses both the Lords and
Commons have most dutifully consented to take 16,000
Hanover troops into our pay. This was openly avowed
by Lord Carteret<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257">[257]</a> in the Upper House, and by those
who made the motion in the Lower. After a debate
which lasted till between 10 and 11 at night our address
was carried by a majority of 109, the numbers being
150 and 259. By that stroke England is become a
province to Hanover, the charge of the military part
of its government already being flung upon us (for who
shall tell when we shall get rid of this burthen?) or how
soon we shall feel the additional part of the same?
The late ministry never attempted anything like it, and
it shows that the new one will stick at nothing to
recommend themselves to the King, the Devil in Milton,
‘<em>with one bound, high overleapt all bound</em>.’... The number
of those that love their country truly, always was and ever
will be but small, and the Saints never yet governed the
Earth, and I believe never will, but true patriotism is not
the less a virtue for that, nor must its votaries leave off
their endeavours or be discouraged at whatever happens.”</p>

bled Mrs. Montagu for a headache in her delicate condition;

<p>A Mr. Twycross, who was in love with Sarah

Montagu. Fortunately, his throat getting better, he
did not use it, to Mrs. Montagu’s relief, who says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had he swallowed it I should have thought there
was love powder in it, for he said a thousand pretty

<div class="sidenote">THE LORD CHANCELLOR</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu was still detained in London, not only
by his parliamentary duties, but for a Chancery suit.
He writes on December 21, lamenting the long separation
“from the ardent object of his desires,” but pleased
to think that the doctor will soon give her permission to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
join him in London. This passage throws light on law
suits of that day—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our petition, as we were made to expect, was to
have been heard this day, but the Lord Chancellor who
has, j think, much more business than any one man can
go through as he ought to do, had so many petitions
that it is thought impossible it should come on sooner
than tomorrow, and may not be till near the beginning
of next term. Part of his Lordship’s time is this day
taken up by his attendance on the King, who comes to
the House of Lords to pass some money bills, in all his
royal pageantry and show. Things of this nature add
a great deal to the plague, expense and delay of Law,
especially in the Court of Chancery. If we are not
heard tomorrow in the forenoon j shall be deprived of
your brother’s<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261">[261]</a> assistance, who was so good as to come
post from Canterbury on Sunday last on purpose, and
must set out again for the same place at noon tomorrow....
This day the House of Commons are to be adjourned
till after the hollydays, and it is talked that the
Session will be at an end by the beginning of March.
The opposition has been carried on with a great deal of
Spirit and will be continued to be so after Xmas, as it is
given out. They intend to make a new ministry wade
through more mire, though they have gone through so
much already. They have got themselves more enemies
in the short time they have been in, than Lord Orford
in his long reign, for they are ruining their country
faster than ever he did, and this infamous job of the
Hanoverian Troops, it’s thought was what he never
would give way to. Several of our young Members
have greatly distinguished themselves by their opposition,
and made it appear that there is no want of the
parts and capacity of those who have so perfidiously
deserted them and the cause of liberty. But none has
done it so eminently as Mr. Pit(t),<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262">[262]</a> who in the opinion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>of several, as well as me, is a greater man than ever
j have sat with, and if he preserves his integrity, will
be transmitted to posterity in the most illustrious of
characters. He is at least equal, if not superior to
Mr. Murray,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263">[263]</a> who has been brought into the House on
purpose to contend with him, and who did the first day
of his entrance by saying everything the cause would
bear in so good a manner, that he gave nobody offence,
which makes me believe he will not serve the ministry
in the slavish, dirty manner other attorneys and solicitor
generals are wont to do, but with more dignity to
himself, if not with more advantage to their cause....</p>

<p>In writing to the Duchess of Portland on December 28
to wish her a happy new year, Mrs. Montagu informs
her she has permission from Dr. Sandys to move towards
London in a fortnight’s time. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall move as slowly as a fat corpse in a herse.
Your grace asks me if I have left off footing and tumbling
down stairs; as to the first, my fidgetations are much
spoiled, sometimes I have cut a thoughtless caper which
has gone to the heart of an old Steward of Mr. Montagu’s,
who is as honest as ‘Trusty’ in the play of <i>Grief à la
Mode</i>. I am told he has never heard a hop that he has
not echoed with a groan. I have taken such heed to
my goings I have not gone down stairs more than by
gradual degrees.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following passage from a letter of Mrs. Donnellan’s
to Mrs. Montagu shows the price paid for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>embroidery of flowers which was much used at this

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have spoken to Jenny Clegg about your sack.
She always works according to the price, the slightest
trimming down to the bottom, of natural flowers she
says will be £8, and the handsomest £12, and between
in proportion. I gave her 4 guineas for my apron, and
she has always three and a half or four for the robings
and facings of a night dress.”</p>
</div>

<p>A “night dress” was what we should call an <i>evening

<div class="sidenote">A COOK</div>

<p>In a letter to Mrs. Donnellan a light is thrown on
that ever-important functionary, a cook. That individual
being required, Mrs. Donnellan had mentioned a cook
who had been with Lady Selina Bathurst. Mrs. Montagu
writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to the Cook being an Irish woman, I think it
can be no objection to me who prefer a lady<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266">[266]</a> of that
country to almost any one of our own; she being a good
catholick is not much, but I think it will not be right to
take her unless Lady Selina Bathurst says she is a good
cook, for had she all the cardinal virtues, and could not
fricasy (<i>sic</i>) and make good soop (<i>sic</i>) I should not know
what to do with her. I would give £15 a year to a very
good cook, but if she is not above being improved, and
I could get her to go into the King’s kitchen, or to any
famous Tavern to learn cookery, I would give a guinea
or two for her teaching, and I heard that in the places
I mention they will take in a person upon such terms.
I suppose she will dress meat on fast days? I like the
character of the woman provided she has had the smallpox,
as I would not have any person in the house who
might run me into the hazard.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANCERY SUIT</div>

<p>On December 28 Mrs. Montagu writes to her husband
she trusts to set out for London on January 9, and hopes
to accomplish the journey in ten or eleven days! The
Chancery suit had been deferred till January 13. A
letter of Thomas Robinson’s regretting his inability to
leave the Kentish Sessions held at Maidstone contains
this passage, “I have already two or three retainers
for that day, and have generally the good fortune to be
employed in every cause, which makes the gains of the
day considerable.”... He winds up with saying he has
delivered his brief of the Montagu case to Mr. Fawcet,
who, he is sure, will make better use of it than he
should.</p>

<p class="smcap">“Dear Madam,</p>

<p class="para1">“I arrived here this evening, without having
suffer’d any inconvenience or fatigue in my whole progress.
We were met on Thursday in Leeming Lane<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267">[267]</a>
by a Messenger from Capt. Twycross to tell us the
waters were out at Burroughbridge, and that we could
not pass them, so I apply’d to my guide, Mr. Carter, and
a wise man is certainly never out of his element. He
told me I might go to Kirby Hill and there get a warm
lodging, though not an elegant one; which he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
would be as well as turning back. For my part I assured
him I had rather have my bed stuffed with flocks than
my pillow with care and disappointment, and agreed
to go on to the place he mentioned, and then send a
messenger to see if the waters were fallen. The Dove
returned with an olive branch, and we went on to the
Waterside<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268">[268]</a> there to prevent fear (for danger there was
none), we got into a boat and navigated through Mr.
Williamson’s gardens, his melancholy yews just shew’d
their formal heads above the water. Himself a melancholy
shade too, was almost in as bad a way, for the
water was quite to his door, so he could get no amusement
from the rest of the world, but what he saw from
the windows. We were safely landed at the door of the
Inn. The coach came through the water without getting
any wet inside of it, and we all rejoiced that we had been
more afraid than hurt. Mr. Carter, in his care, often
bid me be of good courage; as there was not occasion
for any, I could not be disgraced for want of it: from
our first setting out I have not been less entertain’d
than guarded by him, he has really acted the part of
Sir Roger de Coverley all the way; his benevolent heart
breaks into such honest and affectionate expressions, you
would think he was talking to his family wherever he
is; at the ‘Oak-tree’ he was, I saw, shaking hands with
every creature. I stopp’d to speak to a servant of Mrs.
Yorke’s who met us with her compliments, and could
hear Mr. Carter praising the strong beer, thanking the
Landlord, wishing many good things to a boy who was
stuffing a luncheon of bread and butter, thanking Heaven
for good weather, and commending the road, all in a
breath. At Lord Castlecomer’s Inn he would stop for
the horses to eat, he said a sort of grace to it, praying it
might strengthen them to the end of their journey, then
he extolled the Inn, the Landlord and his wife, not forgetting
a ‘lile lass’ that stood at the gate: all the way
we went in the boat he commended the boatmen more
than an envious person would have done Christopher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Columbus, for exploring leas and lands unknown; at
Borough Bridge he made the funeral Elogy of Mr. Mann,
but not to wrong the living for the sake of the dead, he
said the handsomest things to mine Hostess, the civilest
things to her daughters, the most honourable things of
her son, and the most affable things to the chambermaid,
that ever I heard in my life. At Aberforth he was not
less kind to every creature, nor less indulgent to every
thing, and he is the same still, and I doubt not but will
be Sir Roger de Coverley to the end of the journey. I
am really pleased by reflection, and though I don’t see
everything in his point of view, I am delighted at his
happiness, like the bee he gathers honey from every
flower, nay, weed, which to common taste have no perfection.
I wish I could think as well of all mankind as
he does; but he deserves to think better of it. Benevolence
is built so much on faith, that those who think
very ill of people in general, will never do them much
good, for service often arises from trust, and we cannot
trust those whom we dare not believe.”</p>

his wife, despatched a servant named Griffith, but
he, falling ill at an early stage of the road, deputed
another person to meet her. A most dutiful and affectionate
letter occurs here to Mr. Montagu, but too
long for inclusion. Mr. Carter having seen them safe
to Leicester, left them there, where Sarah Robinson
had an attack of illness which delayed them a day.
When well enough, they proceeded by way of Harborough,
Newport Pagnell, Dunstable, etc., to Dover
Street, London.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freind and Mrs. Botham (Mrs. Sterne’s sister,
Lydia), both expecting their confinements, entreated
Mrs. Montagu to stand godmother to their future babes,
to which she consented. Mr. Botham was then Rector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of Yoxall, Staffordshire, and Chaplain to Lord Aylesford,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269">[269]</a>
whose daughter Mary, Lady Andover,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270">[270]</a> was Mrs.
Botham’s most intimate friend and patroness. She was
also a friend of Mrs. Montagu’s, to whom she constantly
wrote tidings of Lydia Botham’s frequent illnesses and
pecuniary troubles.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Rogers had bought East Denton land and
collieries for £10,900 from the Erringtons in 1689, who
had long had the property. In December, 1705, Mr.
Rogers bought of Sir James Clavering his share of
the West Denton property. The history of Denton Hall
will be given further on. Young John Rogers appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to have had fits as early as 1718. He married in 1713,
Anne Delaval, who died in 1723 at Seaton Delaval,
and he seems to have become deranged soon after
her death. As long as his mother lived he was well
cared for, but she died in 1733, and the last nine years
he had been gradually getting worse, and a set of
designing people surrounded him. I have a letter of
his written to his parents, apparently on going to
Oxford in 1705, which is so curious that I insert it here.
It is addressed—</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. MONTAGU’S JOURNEY</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu was made guardian and manager to
Mr. Rogers and his estate. Uneasy as he was at leaving
his wife in her present situation, he was obliged to go
to Newcastle to see into affairs. Sarah Robinson, who
had gone home, was quickly summoned to return to her
sister, to which her parents rather unwillingly gave their
consent. Mr. Montagu writes each post, as often as he
could, most affectionate letters to his wife; as he rode
all the way, disliking a carriage, we see by his letters
the time the journey took. March 19, he writes from
Nottingham, having been four days reaching there. He
says, “If j was mounted as j ought to be j could without
much difficulty reach Allerthorpe on Monday night,
whereas j must now be content if j get there some time
on Tuesday.” He bids her divert herself with her friends
and acquaintances, and to send him good accounts of
her health, “as there is nothing under Heaven that is so
dear to me.”</p>

<p>But no sooner had Mr. Montagu set out than the
Duchess of Portland lost her youngest daughter Frances,
just two years old, from convulsions after whooping
cough. She forbade Mrs. Montagu coming to see her
at first, for fear of her grief affecting her in her present
condition. Mrs. Donnellan and Mrs. Pendarves were
with the duchess, and did all they could to solace her
grief, which was intense. After a few days, however,
the two friends met, and had a sad meeting.</p>

<p>To return to Mr. Montagu’s travels, he got to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
Allerthorpe, where Mr. Carter joined him, and they
proceeded to Newcastle, to Mr. Rogers’ house, where</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“three attorneys attended to take inventorys of the
goods, schedules of the writings and bonds, and whatsoever
we found in the Secretoires etc. of the unhappy
gentleman, but more is owing to the dexterity and unintermitting
diligence of Mr. Carter in the despatch we
have made than to everything else put together. We
have found Bonds amounting to near £10,000 value.”</p>
</div>

<p>A general oversight was arranged to be taken by
Mr. Carter of the estates and tenants, many of the
latter being heavily in arrears in rents. It is characteristic
of Mr. Montagu’s uprightness in business that,
though not obliged to do so, he rendered to Sir James
Clavering, Mr. Rogers’ uncle, a complete account of
his estate, of which Sir James greatly approved, and
regretted these steps were not taken ten years before.
A Mr. Grey was put in charge of Mr. Rogers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DARNTON FAIR</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu and Mr. Carter commenced their
journey home, the latter going to Darnton Fair <i>en
route</i>. People rose early for business then. Mr. Montagu
states Mr. Carter “sat up late last night and rose this
morning at 3, and set out at 6 for Bedale, where he will
be occupied all day.” He adds, “He is unwearied, j
never knew his fellow. He has lived three times as
much as any other man no older than he, and has done
three times as much business and benefited many and
hurt none. I wish j could say as much of those who
are in a rank of life infinitely superior to him.” Truly
this is a fine picture of a righteous steward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIRTH OF A SON</div>

<p>By May 1, when Elizabeth writes to her mother, Mr.
Montagu had returned to her, she and her sister meeting
him at Highgate. Mention is made in this letter of Miss
Brockman having become temporarily speechless from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
inoculation. Sarah returns to Mount Morris, and the last
letter before Mrs. Montagu’s confinement tells of the
purchase of a “magnifique Berceau” just in time, as on
May 11 Mrs. Montagu gave birth, at their house in Dover
Street, to a fine boy, to the infinite joy of Mr. Montagu
and his sister, Mrs. Medows. A young farmer’s wife, a
Mrs. Kennet, living near Mount Morris, had been engaged
as a wet-nurse to the child.</p>

<p>On May 30 the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Freind, to whom Mr.
Montagu had written to announce the birth of his child,
writes to congratulate him, and to say Mrs. Freind had
presented him with a daughter that morning. Mr.
Montagu had promised to stand godfather if it was
a boy,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272">[272]</a> but if a daughter Mrs. Montagu was to be
godmother. To this letter, on June 4, Mr. Montagu
replied that his wife and child are doing well, and he
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The latter end of next week we intend for the
baptism of our infant, and if you were here should be
prouder to have the ceremony performed by you than
anybody else, for if j may judge from what has happened
to the Father, j imagine it would be auspicious to the
Son. I am sure j ought never to forget the share you
had in putting me in the possession of the Mother,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273">[273]</a> in
whom j find my every wish more than compleated. In
less than a fortnight we intend going to Sandleford,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274">[274]</a>
and after that to go on the inoculation, which j hope
will have an happy event, which, if so, j cannot be too
thankful to Providence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INOCULATION</div>

<p>The reader will remember that Mrs. Montagu was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
peculiarly afraid of smallpox, but she had determined,
if once a mother, she would be inoculated, so that she
should be able to attend to her child if it ever had the
disease, and to prevent separation from or infection to
it if she herself took the disease in the natural manner.
When her dread of it is recollected, it will appear a
heroic deed on her part. Her mother, Mrs. Robinson,
was far from easy at the idea of the inoculation taking
place in the summer heat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little boy was christened John, though
he soon acquired the nickname of “Punch,” their own
familiar peep-show, as the fond parents deemed him,
and is only twice mentioned in the letters I have as my
little “Jack.”</p>

<p>In a letter of June 21, from the Duchess of Portland,
who was at Welbeck with Lady Oxford, she mentions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Duke of Kingston<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275">[275]</a> has been in the utmost
danger, so great Doctor Hickman has refrained sleeping
part of a night, not without the assistance of Barbecued
Hog, Tokay, etc., etc., etc. to keep up his spirits, to
enable him to go through the immense fatigue of waking
a few hours with his patron.” She adds, “Thank God
the children are all well. I hope your little man is so,
my best wishes must ever attend the dear boy.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu went to recruit at Sandleford with
Mr. Montagu, preparatory to removing the child and
establishment there, as she writes to her sister Sarah,
who, with Mrs. Medows, is left in Dover Street in
charge of the son and heir—</p>

<p>“I really long to have you here. I think I may say
you never saw anything so pretty as the view these
gardens command, for my part I would not change the
situation for any I ever saw; there is nothing in Nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>pretty that they have not. The prospect is allegro, and
as ‘Mirth with thee I chose to live,’ I am glad it is of
that kind, ‘the loathed melancholy of Cerberus and
blackest midnight, born in Stygeian cave forlorn,’ dare
not appear in this little paradise. There is a charming
grove where your reveries may wander at pleasure, you
may allegorize like Spenser, or pastoralize like the lesser
poets, there are roses and honeysuckles hourly dropping
to put you in mind ‘how small a part of time they
share, that are so wondrous sweet and fair,’ and this
will whisper to you ‘de coglier d’amor la rosa,’ indeed,
my dear Sall, these pretty things are mere toys, as are
all things in this world, but a true friend. I am thankful
for the benefits of fortune, and pleased with them, but
really attached only to the person who bestows them.
My benefactor bestows favours with more pleasure and
more complaisance too, than most people receive them
with, and this gives the relish to favour, for as Ophelia
says, ‘Gifts grow cheap when givers are unkind.’</p>

<p>“I hope the young plant thrives under your care.
Pray write every post, and say all you can about the

girded in his Lion’s skin.”</p>

Bentinck’s pinned to my embroidered quilted petticoat.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SANDLEFORD PRIORY</div>

<p>Sandleford Priory is two miles south of Newbury,
Berks. It was originally founded by Geoffry, 4th Earl of
La Perche, and his wife Matilda of Saxony, between the
years 1193 and 1202, dedicated to St. Mary and St. John
the Baptist, and placed under the Austin Canons; but
<cite>Mr. Money, in his “History of Newbury,”</cite> states “the
recluses of Sandleford” are mentioned in the Pipe Roll
of the 26th of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, 1180, so that a body of religious
had existed there or near before the date of the building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
by the Earl de la Perche.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276">[276]</a> In the reign of Edward IV.,
<i><abbr title="circa">circ.</abbr></i> 1480, a dispute arose between the Prior and the
Bishop of Salisbury, in whose diocese Sandleford lay;
in consequence of this dispute the monastery was forsaken,
and the King, at the instance of the Bishop
(Richard Beauchamp), gave it to the Dean and Chapter
of Windsor. In the 26th of Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> it was stated
to be in their possession, valued at £10.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the time of James <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, 1615, Sandleford was declared
to be a separate parish, and unratable from Newbury,
but the chapel being dismantled and unfit for use, £8 a
year was ordered to be paid to the Rector of Newbury,
which entitled the occupants of the Priory to a seat in
the Newbury parish church, which has been continued
ever since.</p>

<p>The lessees from the Dean and Canons of Windsor
appear, from a paper of my uncle, Lord Rokeby’s, to have
been, early in the eighteenth century, the Pitt Rivers of
Stratfieldsaye, by whom the lease was sold in 1717 to
William Cradock, Esq., after an intermediate alienation.
The lease was purchased in 1730 by Mr. Edward Montagu,
grandson of the 1st Earl of Sandwich. A letter of April,
1733, of Mr. John Rogers to his aunt, the <abbr title="Honourable">Hon.</abbr> Mrs.
Sarah Montagu, at Sandleford, about the death of his
mother, Mrs. Rogers, and her leaving her sister £10,
and each of her three children a ring, is in my possession,
and shows she was then living or staying with her son
Edward.</p>

<p>The chapel is erroneously stated in several works
(<i>vide</i> <cite>Tanner</cite>, etc., etc.) to be destroyed. It was disused,
not destroyed, though the bells, seats, and the tomb
of the crusading knight<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277">[277]</a> had disappeared. As we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>

was used as a bedroom or rooms!</p>

<p>The situation of the Priory is charming, the principal
rooms fronting south on a slight eminence, sloping
to the river Alebourne, now called Enborne, which
crosses the high-road just below the lower lodge, and
skirts the south side of the park. On the east the ground
slopes to a wooded valley, down which are many ponds,
dating from the monks’ time, some of which were joined
together by Mr. Montagu, afterwards more by his widow,
to form lakes. Many fine trees surround it in these
days, and at the time of Mr. Montagu’s first living
there, seem to have been exceedingly numerous; also
walled gardens, which are now removed. Beyond the
valley to the east the ground rises in a wooded ridge.
The village here mentioned must have been a few
cottages near the mill on the west, which existed
where Sandleford Lodge is now built: these have all
long ago disappeared.</p>

<p>To the duchess Mrs. Montagu wrote in raptures of
the beauties of Sandleford, but in the middle of her

his wife and daughter, and I shall not be reconciled to
‘Prunello and grogram’ again a great while, they robbed
me of those hours I could have dedicated to your grace.”

<p>From Sandleford Mrs. Montagu returned to London,
intending to be inoculated, but in a letter of July 12 she
informs the duchess that Dr. Mead considered she had
better defer the operation till the heat of the summer
was over—in September. In the same letter she states
that Mrs. Medows and herself had called on the old
Countess of Granville,<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278">[278]</a> who appears to have been a most
garrulous old lady, and Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She fell with all her violence on my complexion, and
behold, she certainly by her description takes my forehead
to be tortoishell, my cheeks to be gold, my eyes
to be onyx, and my teeth amber: all these are precious
things, but Mr. Montagu not having so rich a fancy as
King Midas, I know not whether he would like such a
wife. Your Grace may believe I was extremely mortified.
The good woman says Mrs. Medows looks better
and younger for being married; but for me I am pale
and green, and describes me as worse than the apothecary
that lives about the rendezvous of death in Caius
Marius. She is of opinion that lying in has spoiled my
face; true it is I have furnished a noble pair of chops to
the little boy, and if mine are a little the lanker for it, I
scarce grudge it....”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is of great consequence to a woman to keep
off disagreeable manners, for the world does not mind
our intrinsic worth so much as the fashion of us, and
will not easily forgive our not pleasing. The men suffer
for their levity in this case, for in a woman’s education
little but outward accomplishment is regarded. Some
of our sex have an affectation of goodness, others a
contempt of it from their education; but the many good
women there are in the world are merely so from nature,
and I think it is much to the credit and honour of
untaught human nature that women are so valuable for
their merit and sense. Sure the men are very imprudent
to endeavour to make fools of those to whom they so
much trust their honour and happiness and fortune, but
it is in the nature of mankind to hazard their peace to
secure power, and they know fools make the best slaves.”</p>

Dr. Mead says it is the best time for me....</p>

<p>“Matlock must be well worth seeing, we have nothing

<p><a id="Footnote_289" href="#FNanchor_289" title="Return to text.">[289]</a> Sarah, the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On Thursday, August 25, Mrs. Montagu took a
sad leave of her little boy, and started on her journey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>to London, sleeping at Windsor, at the house of her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows. Mr. Montagu remained
with the child till the time his wife should be inoculated,
when he was to join her in London, and Mrs. Medows
was to take charge of him. Sarah joined her sister in
London; it will be remembered she had had the disorder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREPARATION FOR INOCULATION</div>

<p>As inoculation is now out of date, I shall extract
from the various letters the mode of procedure. Arrived
in Dover Street, Mrs. Montagu is told by Elias, the
duchess’s porter (then a most important domestic
magnate), his mistress was coming to London on
Monday. She therefore writes to beg the duchess, the
duke, and Mr. Achard to dine with her that day “at 4
or 5 according to their convenience.” Business, however,
prevented the duchess leaving Bullstrode for a
week, but she is reinvited, as Dr. Mead says Mrs.
Montagu will not be infectious till the disease appears.
Meanwhile, in preparation for the dreaded operation,
she was “dosed, then blooded, another dose or two of
physick is all I shall want, and then proceed to meet
that distemper I have been running from these four and
twenty years: it is at present my misfortune the smallpox
is so little stirring they cannot find a subject.” She
writes to the duchess also in another letter, “Though
Dr. Mead, Dr. Cotes, Mr. Hawkins, and the subaltern of
the Physical faculty, the Apothecary, have been smallpox-hunting
this week, they have not procured a subject
for me.” She urges the duchess to dine, “as I shall be
as well till 7 or 9 days after the operation as ever I was
in my life.”</p>

<p>The duchess had been out of order with hysterical
fits, and states she was ordered to drive in a chaise. Of
this vehicle we gain a glimpse from this allusion of
Mrs. Montagu’s in answer to the duchess, “A chaise is
health, spirits and speed, a lady must lay aside her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>hoop, her laziness and pride, before she is diminutive
enough for a chaise.” A portion of a very beautiful
letter, written by Mrs. Montagu to her husband before
he joins her, I copy—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Dover Street, Tuesday, August 30.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“The happiest moments I have spent since I
parted from you, were those I employed in reading your
letter: accept the sincerest thanks a grateful and tender
heart can make to the most kind and generous love.
While Heaven shall lend me life, I will dedicate it to
your service, and I hope our tender engagements shall
not be broke by the cruel hand of fate. Notwithstanding
the distemper I am going into, I have great hopes of
my life, and a certainty of my love to you as long as that
life shall last. Your kind behaviour and conversation
has made my Being of such value to me that I am taking
the best means to preserve and secure it from hazards,
but let not the experiment cost you an anxious thought.
It would be a reproach to the laws of Nature, if one as
virtuous as you are, should not be sure to be happy. I
trust you shall ever be so independent of a weak woman,
who can serve you in nothing but wishes: could I reflect
back the happiness I receive from you, I should tremble
at my own importance to think of sinking from happiness
to insensibility, and nothing might overcome my little
courage, but to imagine I left you a portion of sorrow
and regret as a burthen on all your years to come, would
not only afflict but even distract me.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REV. CHRISTOPHER DONNELLAN</div>

<p>The same day that she wrote this letter to her
husband, she writes a note to Mrs. Donnellan, who
had joined her brother, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Christopher Donnellan,
at Tunbridge Wells. He, having been ordered to drink
the waters, and having crossed from Ireland for that
purpose, Mrs. Montagu says, “Does not your brother
think he is in Babel? How does he like English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>women with French dresses and French manners? In
short, what does grave good sense think of Tunbridge?”</p>

<p>By Mr. Montagu’s desire, Dr. Sandys was added to
the previous M.D.’s. A day or two after this Mr. Montagu
joined her, and she was inoculated on September 3.</p>

in myself to be disturbed at the approach of a distemper
I have been seeking. The Duchess of Portland spent
the day with me on Monday, and was here again with
Lady Wallingford yesterday, and I expect her Grace this
afternoon. In the meantime I hope to hear from you,
and my sister will give you intelligence of me. Dr.
Mead and Dr. Cotes attend me; I have given them on

Dr. Mead attends constantly, one guinea a day will be

it was nothing, upon which the great Captain sent a
H(anoveria)n officer, who brought word it was the musket
of a soldier upon guard; the Captain then cry’d he could

I shall be ill yet. I shall be glad when the proper

I may venture to write, or if you should not be quite
well, my letter is of no consequence, and may be thrown
by. I will allow all your reasoning for yourself to be
very good, and will not dispute with you now, whether
you are of consequence to the world or not, I will only
beg you to act as if you were, and take care of yourself
for the sake of the few, and let the world come in for its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>share of you by an by. I am of opinion one guinea a
day is sufficient from a private gentle woman to any
Physician in England, if he makes but one visit. I know
all our family, and greater than us never gave more
either to Hollins or Willmot; indeed if they prescribe
twice they must be paid twice, but that I hope and
believe will not be your case. I am not acquainted with
anyone who makes use of Dr. Mead, but I suppose he is

these sort of things on one another when they are already
high enough by conscience is wrong....</p>

Lady Catherine Hanmer that I care particularly for, and
they stay, I am quite easy about the matter. I generally
take a rural walk with my maid and man, and I am just

but the wounds appeared healed. From this it appears
the surgeon attended the wounds daily, and doctors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
occasionally. The very next day (September 13) Mr.
Hawkins pronounced there was no longer a chance of
the smallpox.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes to the duchess, “As Anacreon
who swallowed many a hogshead of the juice of the
grape was at last killed with a little grape stone, I who
have missed the dire disease, am grumbling with the
toothache.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">POPE’S GROTTO</div>

<p>The duchess writes to Mrs. Montagu to beg her to
think that though the smallpox has <em>not</em> appeared, she
is as much secured as if it had. On September 15,
as a wind-up to the inoculation, Mrs. Montagu “was
blooded.”</p>

<p>“On Saturday we went to see Mr. Pope’s<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296">[296]</a> garden
and grotto, to Hampton Court and Bushey Park,” she
writes to the duchess; and on Wednesday she was intending
to pay a visit to her parents at Mount Morris,
Kent, before returning to her child, for whom, she says,
“her heart sickens.” On October 8 she proceeded to
Sandleford, leaving Mr. Montagu, who had business, to
follow in a few days; and she writes to the duchess from
the inn at Maidenhead Bridge. In this letter she says
she has great difficulty in “squeezing the cotton in the
ink bottle which I am forced to do before each word,
and as my pen is as prodigal of ink, as the bottle is
sparing of it, after I have been half an hour replenishing
my pen, one inconsiderate blot squanders it away.”
This alludes to the strange habit of having cotton placed
in the inn inkstand, under the delusion that it made
it last longer. The whole writing of the letter is thick
and blotted. She also mentions, “My sister set out for
Bath this morning, with Mrs. Cotes. Poor madam Sally’s
stomach is greatly out of order, and her nerves are
often affected, but I hope the waters will do her good.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HIGHWAYMAN</div>

<p>Mrs. Cotes was the doctor’s wife, and a sister of Lord
Irwin, a great friend of Sally’s, very small in stature and
pretty, familiarly called “the <em>little</em> Madam.” The two
ladies, accompanied by Mrs. Cotes’ footman, set out for
Bath, diverging from Newbury for a night at Sandleford
to see “Punch.” A passage from a letter of Sarah’s will
show the perils of the road. They travelled in a post-chaise—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A man set out with us from London, and kept us
company about seven miles. He often asked the footman
who we were, and whether we were going over
Hounslow Heath; to the last he made no answer, but
after being tired with his curiosity told him we were
only ladies’ maids, upon which he forsook us, either
being too proud to accompany abigails, or supposing
we had not money enough to make it worth his while
to go on to Hounslow Heath with us. We had one
post-boy that pleased us extremely, he sung all the
way, our pleasure did not arise from any music in his
voice, but from seeing him so happy, and admiring the
power of a contented spirit, that could make a person so
joyful, that was at the caprice of any one, without any
greater advantage than a shilling’s reward, and who is
always to be jolted almost to death, by the only creatures
that are beneath him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Almost shaken to pieces, they arrived at their
lodgings at Mrs. Elliot’s, in the Orange Grove, Bath.
Sarah describes the rooms as small, but comfortable,
“looking down Wade’s Passage and into the coffee-house,
which is a guard to the windows, and very
often prevents their approach.” She grumbles at the
expense of their journey, but says provisions are cheap,
fowls one shilling each.</p>

<p>Jenny, her maid, had travelled by coach, a post-chaise
of that time only holding two people. Here is a passage
worthy of Fielding, “Jenny travelled down unspotted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>and pure with the old parson, who gave her no comfort,
but one spiritual kiss upon getting to the end of their
journey.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DANGERS OF A POST-CHAISE</div>

<p>Both Mrs. Cotes and Sarah suffered from the hardness
of the post-chaise, and Sarah also hints that other
<em>visible</em> effects had been incurred which would last for
days; hence fleas, if not worse, must have existed in it!
Mrs. Montagu, in writing to condole with them, says,
“It is a daring mind that ventures in a post-chaise.
I wonder the partizans of these vehicles do not establish
a broad bottom, and a competent share of cushion.”
The vehicle was, from what I make out, a two-wheeled
chaise. Mrs. Cotes’ footman had been directed to call,
on his way back to London, on Mrs. Montagu. The
style of speech of a servant of this period is shown in
this passage—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Cotes’ man called very civilly, and brought
me your last letter. ‘Pray, Mr. Thomas,’ says I, ‘did you
leave the ladies well?’ ‘Yes, and very merry, Madam.’
‘They had a good journey, I hope?’ ‘Yes, a very merry,
Madam.’ ‘They were not at all afraid?’ ‘No, nothing
but very merry, Madam.’ ‘Were they not tired when
they came to their inns?’ ‘No, always very merry,
Madam!’ At last Thomas’s account made me ‘so merry,
Madam,’ I was forced to retire to laugh.</p>

<p>“Your nephew gets his share of sunshine every day,
his teeth tease him and produce the dew of sorrow on
his little cheeks sometimes, but in a moment it is forgotten,
and he is always lively, and in continual health:
he is thought to grow like his mother, so I think I may
cease to be handsome with a good grace, as I have transferred
it to my offspring.... Your nephew is in his birthday
suit, laughing so I can hear him through the doors;
the usurpation and authority of those bandages called
garments he is too full of Whig principles to approve
of!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PUNCH’S” CHARIOT</div>

<p>There were no babies’ carriages in those days, so
little Punch drove out daily in the <em>chariot</em>, not to be
confounded with the <em>coach</em>, a much larger vehicle.</p>

<p>In the same letter it appears that the good old Yorkshire
steward, Mr. Carter, had had a bad fall, and the
house in Dover Street not being large enough, Morris
Robinson was trying to secure them one in Bruton
Street. Mrs. Montagu, having suffered from weakness
and hysterical fits, was recommended to ride daily—a
pastime which was agreeably varied by the cutting of
new walks through the Sandleford woods, and the continual
amusement afforded to her and Mr. Montagu
by the contemplation of their child’s too precocious
ways.</p>

<p>A few details of life at Bath may prove amusing.
Sarah writes to her sister that the waters agree very
well with her, but that people are amazed at her walking
between each glass. She had found a companion in
Mrs. Wadman, Lord Windsor’s sister, whom she had
met at the pump-room, as they drank the waters about
the same time, and both were fond of walking.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. Freind and his wife were at Bath, and
Sarah goes to hear him preach a charity sermon,</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BATH BALL</div>

<p>At one of the balls Sarah did not dance, but she
said she did not regret it, “having no inclination to
dance with any man but Mr. Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299">[299]</a> and that I have not
acquaintance enough with him to expect, I can only
cherish my hopes of future good fortune.” At another
ball she dances with Mr. Vanburgh, “a very pretty sort
of man, but our affections to him are quite Platonic, as
he is in love with the youngest Miss Nash.” This must
have been the sister or daughter of Mr. Richard Nash<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300">[300]</a>
(“Beau Nash”), the despotic Master of the Ceremonies at
Bath. He was not well at this time, and Mrs. Montagu
sends her kind regards and condolences on his health.
Amongst other people mentioned at Bath by Sarah
were the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Berkeley, Mr.
Powlett, and Mr. Bathurst, son of Lady Selina, the
two Offleys, Mr. Greville, and Lord Robert Carr, said
to be very handsome.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I played at Shuttlecock about half an hour, there
were five couple of us: in truth I played so much better
than any in the room, I put them all in amazement, but
it was rather owing to their bad play, and to my being
matched with the two men that played the best, than my
superior skill.... In my last I mentioned I was going
to the ball: there was a table of sweetmeats, jellies,
wine, Biskets, cold Ham and Turkey set behind two
Screens, which at 9 o’clock were taken away, and the
table discovered.... Above stairs there was a hot
supper for all that would take the trouble to go up.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MATHEMATICAL INSTERATION!”</div>

<p>The ignorance of some ladies of this period is shown
by Sarah in the following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A lady told us last night that Miss Molyneux is so
great a <em>Mathematician</em> that she can <em>inster</em> Greek, and that
often a dozen of the most learned men of the Kingdom
had puzzled their wise heads about a piece of Greek,
and could make nothing of it; they proposed to send
it to Miss Molyneux, and she <em>instered</em> it (<i>alias</i> construed
it), and returned them her <em>insteration</em>!”</p>
</div>

<p>Whilst Sarah was at Bath, Mrs. Montagu wrote
frequently to her mother at Mount Morris, much,
naturally enough, about her child, about whom the
fond grandmother was never tired of hearing. A little
sentence gives a clue to his looks, “If my Father has
drawn a blue-eyed simpering Cherubim, you may fancy
him not unlike your grandchild; the child’s eyelashes
are black and long, and he has a laughing look in his
eyes, blue, like my Father.” He was still toothless, and
suffered much with his gums, which made his mother
already uneasy. Mr. Montagu had just taken some
prodigious sized carp from a fish-pond at Sandleford,
and was throwing three of the old monks’ ponds, or fish
stews, into one large one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan writes from Bullstrode on October 21,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>

is a melancholy example of the decay of trade,
there is misery and poverty and lawless necessity in
an unhappy abundance. We have robbing upon the
commons here very frequently: a poor labourer who
has been digging in our garden last week was very
oddly preserved from a wound by a Buckler made of
Cheese, like Sardella in ‘The Rehearsal.’ The poor
man had five shillings in his pocket, when he was
stopped by a footpad. He did not care to surrender
his wealth, and so resisted; another robber came to his
comrade’s assistance, and stuck a knife several inches
deep into some cheese and bread he had over his
bosom, in a wallet betwixt his coat and waistcoat. We
had a highwayman taken by a French dancing master
a little while ago. When the dancing master carried
him before the Justice of Peace, the Justice asked what
day of the month he was robbed? ‘Ah,’ says the
dancing master, ‘me can no tell dat,’ but turns to
the highwayman, ‘but you do know, I pray tell Monsieur,

the highwayman denied the fact of the robbery, was as

is certainly worthy to have the precedency over all
foolish Poets. I like the last Dunciad for exposing
more sorts of follies than the first did, which was
merely upon bad poets and bad criticks. I am always
glad when I see those fops who have translated their
manners and language into French foppery well ridiculed
for the absurd metamorphosis, to ridicule wrong
placed pride is of great service, for if it was not done
this land would be over-run with conceit, for here
people are proud of their vices and follies and iniquity,
and as long as Pride arises from such Stocks, we shall
never want an increase of it. Milton says, ‘<i>Nought
profits more than self-esteem right placed</i>,’ and surely
it is true of that pride that makes us disdain vice, but
that which makes people glory in it is as pernicious.
The British vice of gluttony is openly professed so
much, one can hardly dine at a fashionable table where
eating is not the discourse the whole time, and treated
of as an affair of the utmost consequence.”</p>

By this learned person’s instruction was Dr. Pococke<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311">[311]</a>

our agent in Paris in relation to the removal of the Pretender’s
Son out of France, in pursuance of treaties which
in substance is as follows, viz.:—‘That engagements
entered into by treaties are not binding any further

parties on all sides. That when the King of
England shall have caused satisfaction to be given on
the repeated complaints that have been made to him of
the infractions of these very treaties of which he now

this there was a long affidavit of a Master of the packet

who was called the Chevalier, and said to be the Pretender’s

<p>Mrs. Montagu and her sister now joined Mr. Montagu

Towards Uxbridge we met a leathern vehicle called a

for a guinea.” A capucin Mrs. Robinson had ordered;
she says, “I like my capucin much better than that
which was shorter, and it is quite good enough for

a deep cape, as in a previous letter the garment is

Dettemere, of whom more anon. This poor woman
appears to have been in a good position of life, and
well known to the Robinsons, but unhappy circumstances
had placed her in great distress. Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

£5 to lay out in ribbons, and get her customers, and she

<p>Writing to Mrs. Donnellan on June 7, Mrs. Montagu
says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The country is now extremely delightful, all nature
is in bloom, every being joyous and happy, it seems to
me impossible that any citizen of so fair a world should
harbour any gloomy care in their breast. It is a vain
pretence we make to delicacy and taste, while we prefer
a dirty town to the country in the fine Season: all the
arts of luxury cannot invent any pleasures equal to
what one receives from soft air, moderate sunshine, a
gay scene of prospect and the musick of the feather’d
songsters. Sir William Temple<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334">[334]</a> says his three wishes
were, ‘health, peace and fair weather.’ I have often

admired sentences.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, the faithful north-country agent, was now
at Sandleford, and on June 15 Mrs. Montagu writes to
her sister, who was staying at Chilston in Kent with
the Thomas Bests. Mr. Best had married Caroline, <i>alias</i>
“Cally,” Scott, of Scott’s Hall, the intimate friend of
both sisters. A most happy marriage it appears to have
been—</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORANGE TREES</div>

<p>The Duchess of Portland had promised to give a
dozen orange trees from Bullstrode to Mrs. Montagu,
which she was most anxious to have. These trees were
to be sent to the Red Lyon at Slough, where the Newbury
carrier was to take them up. They arrived, after the
following vicissitudes, safely:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The poor waggoner who was to have brought them
was unhappily killed some days ago by a loaded waggon
falling on him; his servant foolishly left the orange trees
because he said he had no room for them, and at 9 o’clock
at night they brought us word the orange trees were
left at Slough. We immediately sent servants with a
cart who travelled almost all night, and brought the
trees safe, the next day. They have not received the
least damage, they are blooming, full of fragrance,” says
Mrs. Montagu in her letter of thanks. She also asks for
Mr. Achard to instruct her as to their culture, “whether
they should be nailed to the wall, without pruning their
heads, and thirdly what size the tubs should be for those
that are to be kept in that manner.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Achard’s instructions were sent, but alas! are
lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu being obliged to go to the North to
attend to business of his own, and as trustee to Mr.
Rogers, Mrs. Montagu had determined on accompanying
him and taking “Punch” and her sister Sarah
with them. It was with some difficulty she obtained
leave of her parents for her sister’s company, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
considered she had been so much away from them.
Sarah was desired not to come in the stage-coach from
Horton, but by a post-chaise or chariot at Mrs. Montagu’s
expense, and</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. JAMES MONTAGU —<br>
CAMBRIDGE AND STOWE</div>

<p>The following letter to the Duchess of Portland was
written from Newbold Verdon, Mr. James Montagu’s
seat in Leicestershire. He was the elder half-brother
of Mr. Montagu by Mr. Charles Montagu’s first wife,
Elizabeth Forster, daughter of Sir James William
Forster, of Bamborough Castle, Northumberland. Newbold
Verdon had been left to Mr. James Montagu by
his uncle by marriage, Nathaniel, Baron Crewe of
Stene, who married Dorothy Forster.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I did not set out on my journey so soon as we
proposed; the letter we sent to my brother Montagu
having made the tour of England before it reached him,
so we waited for an answer. The 31st of July we set
out for Oxford, where we spent an agreeable day in
seeing new objects and old friends. The good people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
from Witney<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342">[342]</a> were so kind as to come over to see us,
and show us what was best worthy our attention. The
University, I think, is finer than Cambridge, but does
not excel so much as I had imagined. Alma Mater,
however, presides in great dignity there. I had hoped
to have seen Mr. Potts,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343">[343]</a> but was informed he was at
Bullstrode, or I should have sent to have begged the

<p>“The mighty Shaw<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344">[344]</a> had left the classic ground to
take care of his glebe in the country. The first of August
we went to Stowe,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345">[345]</a> which is beyond description, it gives
the best idea of Paradise that can be; even Milton’s
images and descriptions fall short of it, and indeed a
Paradise it must be to every mind in a state of innocence.
Without the soul’s sunshine every object is dark, but a
contented mind must feel the most ‘sober certainty of
waking bliss.’ The buildings<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346">[346]</a> are indeed in themselves
disagreeably crowded, but being dedicated to Patriots,
Heroes, Lawgivers and Poets, men of ingenuity and
invention, they receive a dignity from the persons to
whom they are consecrated. Others that are sacred to
imaginary powers, raise pleasing enthusiasm in the
mind. What different ideas arise in a walk in Kensington
Gardens, or the Mall, where almost every face wears
impertinence, the greater part of them unknown, and
those whom we are acquainted with, only discover to us
that they are idle, foolish, vain and proud. At Stowe
you walk amidst Heroes and Deities, powers and persons
whom we have been taught to honour, who have embellished
the world with arts, or instructed it in Science,
defended their country and improved it. The Temples
that pleased me most for the design to which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>were consecrated, were those to ‘Ancient Virtue,’<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347">[347]</a> to
‘Friendship,’<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348">[348]</a> and to ‘Liberty.’</p>

<p>“On Saturday last we arrived at my brother
Montagu’s, who has made this place one of the most
charming and pleasant I ever saw: the gardens are
delightful, the park very beautiful, the house neat and
agreeable, and everything about it in an elegant taste.
My brother has made great improvements. It was a
very bad place when Lord Crewe left it to him, and
had no ornament but fine wood; now there is water
in great beauty, grand avenues from every point, fine
young plantations, and in short, everything that can
please the eye. But nothing gives me so much pleasure
as the obliging and friendly reception of the Master,
who has entertained us in a kind and elegant and
magnificent manner. The regularity and order of the
family, and the happiness that appears in the countenance
of every friend and servant, gives one pleasure to
observe it....</p>

<div class="sidenote">“PUNCH’S” DEATH</div>

<p>In a letter to the Duchess of Portland of August 19,
Mrs. Montagu said her boy had borne the journey
well, and was “quite well.” She intended to leave him
in Mrs. Carter’s care whilst she accompanied Mr.
Montagu to Newcastle, where the air was not healthy,
and roads very bad. Alas! a few days after, poor little
“Punch,” in cutting another tooth, was taken with
convulsion fits and died. The exact date I am unaware
of. <cite>Lodge, in his “Peerage of Irish Peers,”</cite> states
he died on August 17, and was buried at Burneston.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351">[351]</a>
The date of the day is wrong, as will be perceived by
her letter to the duchess. My grandfather simply states
he died of convulsion fits, occasioned by teething, no
date; but as Mrs. Freind wrote to condole with Mrs.
Montagu on September 3, it must have happened soon
after her letter to the duchess. As no parents, from
their letters, could have adored an infant more than the
Montagus, it may be judged what a blow this was to
them. Many sweet passages about this child have I
suppressed from want of space. He seems to have been
of a too precocious nature in mind and body. He was
so large he wore shoes big enough for a child of four.
He ran alone and talked, and mimicked people’s manners
and ways, and was only one year and three months
old! “Our little cherub,” “our sweet angel,” as his
father constantly writes of him. The noble way in
which both his parents supported their anguish will be
seen by future extracts from letters. Dr. Freind’s fine
letter of condolence to Mrs. Montagu is indorsed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
back, “Letter from Dr. Freind on the unhappy loss of
my son,” and is much worn with constant reading.
He had lost two children, and was then threatened with
the loss of his father,<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352">[352]</a> whom he adored. The poor
Montagus, much as they desired children, never had
any more. I sometimes think that this poignant and
irrevocable loss turned Elizabeth Montagu’s thoughts
more strongly to literature and knowledge of all kind.
She sought to occupy her mind as a solace for grief,
but she never forgot her loss, and every now and then
the bitterness of it is shown in passages in her letters.</p>

write what might be understood. I am well enough as
to health of Body, but God knows the sickness of the
soul is far worse. However, as so many good friends
interest themselves for me, I am glad I am not ill. I
know it is my duty to be resigned and to submit; many
far more deserving than I am have been as unfortunate.
I hope time will bring me comfort. I will assist it
with my best endeavours; it is in affliction like mine
that reason ought to exert itself else one should fall
beneath the stroke. I apply myself to reading as much
as I can, and I find it does me service. Poor Mr.
Montagu shows me an example of patience and fortitude,
and endeavours to comfort me, though undoubtedly
he feels as much sorrow as I can do, for he
loved his child as much as ever parent could do. My
sister has been of great service to me; and on this,
as on all other occasions, a most tender friend. I am
much obliged to you for wishing yourself with so unhappy
a companion: your conversation would be a
cordial to my spirits, but I should be afraid of being
otherwise to yours. Adieu, think of me as seldom as
you can, and when you do, remember I am patient,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>and hope that the same Providence that snatched this
sweetest blessing from me, may give me others, if
not I will endeavour to be content, if I may not be
happy. Heaven preserve you and your dear precious
Babes; thank God you are far removed from my misfortune,
and can hardly fear to be bereft of all.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354">[354]</a></p>

<p>Lady Andover wrote from Charlton, Wilts, “by
Highworth Bag,” to condole with her friend. In this
letter she mentions that her friend, Lydia Botham (Mrs.
Laurence Sterne’s sister), had nearly died at the birth of
a daughter (Catherine), but was better. Matthew Robinson
wrote and implored his sister to accompany her
husband to Newcastle. He says, “Books and thought
are the food of melancholy, and lovely places, however
beautiful, the dwellings of it, but a town entirely strange
to you, and new company, would bid fairest to dissipate
your thoughts.” He signs himself “Matthew Robinson
Morris,” having adopted the latter, the maiden name of
his mother, as her heir to the Mount Morris and Monk’s
Horton estates. Mrs. Donnellan, writing from Bullstrode
on September 24, mentions, “I have brought
down a screen to work in snail for the Duchess, and
for my retired hours, Carte’s<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355">[355]</a> <cite>History</cite> to read, for Sir

an emblem of life, the first scene was all gay figures and
dogs and Ducks and Horses and Coaches, and every
object was new and striking: then came Mademoiselle
Catherina with all the airs of a celebrated toast, turned
her head about with a measured grace, smiled, curtseyed,
and flirted her fan: when everyone had enough of that,
we went to study the world. We observed its motion,
saw the revolution of a few years, and while we rather
admired than understood its movements, were almost

such roads. I never saw such roads in my life as between
Harborough and this place. We were obliged to come
a nameless pace that is slower than a walk. Mr. Montagu
is to meet us to-morrow, he expected our being at Newport
to-night, but we did not get to Northampton till
after three o’clock in the afternoon, though we got into
the coach at seven in the morning.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter of November 23 the duchess says, “I have
read a sermon of Swift’s upon the Trinity, which I like
extremely, and wish you would read it, and give me

<div class="sidenote">DISEASE IN CATTLE</div>

<p>At Bullstrode at this time were Lady Wallingford
and Miss Granville. On the same day Mrs. Robinson
writes from Mount Morris and congratulates her
daughters on their safe arrival in Dover Street. She
mentions the cattle plague then beginning; thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our epidemical distemper is madness, which, thank
God, has not yet reached the human species, but reigns
among horses, cows, hoggs, shepp, and doggs; of the
latter we have been one out of pocket, but our new
tenant has lost a cow, and has a ram uncommonly
freakish, which they suppose is going the same way,
and J. Smith a hogg or two, and the country people
take so little care of their doggs when they are bitt, as
is very injurious to their neighbours. Ours was a greyhound,
which will prevent Mr. Robinson’s coursing till
he recruits his loss with another.”</p>
</div>

<p>Poor Mrs. Robinson, only three weeks after this
letter, wrote to her daughters to say she had a swelling
in her breast, which had formed some ten weeks back,
and which she had hitherto concealed, and feared
was cancer. She wrote to Dr. Chesilden,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 359">[359]</a> the famous

alludes to the death of the second Mrs. Conyers Middleton,

take it for granted, if he goes he is to be an Irish Bishop.
It is very strange that no one can be contented with
their present state, for though the Doctor is neither
great nor rich, he has more than he wants, and can
spend his time in such studies as he chuses, and his
vacant hours in the company he has been used to, which
I think to one between 60 and 70, would be no small

and when they showed us Chaucer’s well, I desired some
Helicon, hoping thereby to write you a more poetical
letter, but the place having been, during the last Civil
War, besieged, the Muses were frightened away, and
forbade this spring to flow, so it is entirely choaked
up, and where flourished Laurels and Bays, grows only
uncouth thorns and thistles. Where erst the Muses and
the Graces played in the best room of the Castle, now
stink a few tame partridges: in short, the present owner,
having none of the divine enthusiasm of poetry, has
turned the Castle to barbarous uses. Above it is a
partridge Mew, below a court is kept for paying fines

<p>Mrs. Montagu had been far from well this spring and
summer, with lowness of spirits and nervous fainting
attacks. Dr. Mead prescribed riding as a remedy, and
finally advised her to take the waters at Tunbridge
Wells. Mr. Montagu being obliged to go to the North
about his own and Mr. Rogers’ affairs, it was agreed
that she should drink the waters whilst he was absent.</p>

<p>Lady Wallingford, who had been paying them a long
visit, set out for Bath. Mrs. Montagu left Sandleford,
August 18, for London, with Mr. Montagu, and left for
Tunbridge Wells on the 20th, Mr. Montagu leaving for
the North on August 29.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. YOUNG AND CIBBER!</div>

<p>Writing from Tunbridge Wells to the Duchess of
Portland on August 27, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have great joy in Dr. Young, whom I disturbed
in a reverie, and at first he started, then bowed, then
fell back into a surprise, then began a speech, relapsed
into his astonishment two or three times.... I told
him your Grace desired he would write longer letters,
to which he cried “Ha!” most emphatically, and I leave
you to interpret what it meant. He has made a friendship
with one person here, whom I believe you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
not imagine to have been made for his bosom friend....
You would not guess that this associate of the Doctor’s
was old <em>Cibber</em>!<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363">[363]</a> Certainly in their religious, moral and
civil character there is no relation, but in their Dramatic
capacity there is some. But why the Reverend Divine
and serious author of the melancholy ‘<cite>Night Thoughts</cite>’
should desire to appear as a <i>persona dramatis</i> here, I
cannot imagine. The waters have raised his spirits to a
fine pitch, as your Grace will imagine when I tell you
how sublime an answer he made to a very vulgar
question. I asked him how long he staid at the Wells?
He said ‘as long as my rival staid!’ I was astonished
how one who made no pretensions to anything could
have a rival, so I asked him for an explanation: he said
he would stay as long as the <em>Sun</em> did!”</p>

very hilly country, some of which afforded very delightful
prospects, and about 12 miles over a rich, flat

much service.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DR. YOUNG</div>

<p>With Dr. Young’s company she was delighted, and
she rode with him often. One ride she describes thus—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been in the vapours these two days, on
account of Dr. Young’s leaving us: he was so good as
to let me have his company very often, and we used to
ride and walk and take sweet counsel together. A few
days before he went away, he carried Mrs. Rolt<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373">[373]</a> and
myself to Tunbridge,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374">[374]</a> five miles from hence, where we
were to see some fine ruins.... First rode the Doctor
on a tall steed, decently caparizoned in grey; next
ambled Mrs. Rolt on a hackney horse lean as the famed
Rosinante, but in shape much resembling Sancho’s ass;
then followed your humble servant on a milk white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Palfrey, whose reverence for the human kind induced
him to be governed by a creature not half as strong
and I fear scarce thrice as wise as himself. The two
figures that brought up the rear, the first was my
servant valiantly armed with two uncharged pistols,
whose holsters were covered with two civil harmless
monsters, that signified the valour and courtesy of our
ancestors. The last was the Doctor’s man, whose uncombed
hair so resembled the mane of the horse he
rode on, one could not help imagining they were of
him.... On his head was a velvet cap much resembling
a black saucepan, and on his side hung a little basket.
Thus did we ride, or rather jog on to Tunbridge town.
To tell you how the dogs barked at us, the children
squalled, and the men and women stared at us, would
take too much time.... At last we arrived at the
‘King’s Head’: the loyalty of the Doctor induced him
to alight.... We took this progress to see the ruins of
an old Castle; but first our Divine would visit the
Churchyard, where we read that folks were born and
died, the natural, moral, and physical history of Mankind.
In the Churchyard grazed the Parson’s Steed,
whose back was worn bare with carrying a pillion Seat
for the comely, fat personage, this ecclesiastic’s wife.
Though the creature eat daily part of the parish, he was
most miserably lean. Tired of dead and living bones,
Mrs. Rolt and I jumped over a stile into the Parson’s
field, and from thence, allured by the sight of golden
Pippins, we made an attempt to break into the holy

invited us to his apple-trees; to show our moderation
we each of us gathered two mellow codlings....</p>

<p>“The good parson offered to show us the inside of
his Church, but made some apology for his undress,
which was a truly canonical dishabille. He had on a
grey striped calamanco night gown, a wig that once
was white, but by the influence of an uncertain climate
turned to a pale orange, a brown hat, encompassed by a
black hatband, a band somewhat dirty that decently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>retired under his chin, a pair of grey stockings well
mended with blue worsted, strong symbol of the conjugal
care and affection of his wife, who had mended
his hose with the very worsted she bought for her
own.... When we had seen the Church, the parson
invited us to take some refreshment, but Dr. Young
thought we had before trespassed on the good man’s
time, so desired to be excused, else we should, no doubt,
have been welcomed to the house by Madam in her
muslin pinners and sarsenet hood, who would have
given some Mead and a piece of a cake that she made in
the Whitsun holidays for her cousins.”</p>

was built by Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, in
William Rufus’ days. It has been a most magnificent
building, the situation is extremely beautiful: the Castle
made a kind of half moon down to the river, and where
the river does not defend it, it is guarded by a large
moat. The towers at the great Gate are covered with
fine venerable ivy. It was late in the evening before
we got home, but the silver Cynthia held up her lamp
in the heavens, and cast such a light on the earth, as
showed its beauties in a soft and gentle light. The
night silenced all but our Divine Doctor, who sometimes
uttered things fit to be spoken in a Season when
all Nature seems to be hushed and hearkening. I
followed gathering wisdom as I went, till I found by my
horse’s stumbling that I was in a bad road, and that the
blind was leading the blind: so I placed my servant
between the Doctor and myself, which he not perceiving,
went on in a most philosophical strain to the great

being brought up to any pitch of enthusiasm, nor
making answer to any of the fine things he heard, the

the man to trot on before.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GEORGE LEWIS SCOTT —<br>
NATIONAL TERRORS</div>

<p>This letter frightened Mrs. Montagu much. She
immediately wrote to propose joining Mr. Montagu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
and despatched a messenger to London to ask advice
from a person likely to know about the affair. This
person was Mr. George Lewis Scott,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377">[377]</a> eldest son of
George Scott, of Bristo in Scotland, by Marion Stewart,
daughter of Sir James Stewart, Lord Advocate of
Scotland. He was a great friend of George <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and had
his names given to him by the Princess Sophia,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378">[378]</a> who was
his godmother. He was a most able mathematician,
which formed a tie between himself and Mr. Montagu.
He was a tall, big man, very sociable and facetious,
an accomplished musician. In 1750 he was Sub-Preceptor
to George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, and in 1756 Commissioner of
Excise. I give a portion of his letter in reply; his
handwriting is beautiful—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hearing of an express said to arrive last night, I
went out in search of news, but find nothing material
since the account of the unhappy battle,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379">[379]</a> or rather
infamous flight, of Saturday last. We have as yet no
authentic detail of the action. The common opinion is,
that the King’s forces both horse and foot behaved
scandalously. Inclosed I send you a list of some officers
killed and wounded in this affair. We do not yet know
what is become of the rest, excepting that the greatest
part of the Dragoons were safe at Berwick with Sir John
Cope.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380">[380]</a> The Captain Stewart of the Earl of Loudoun’s
Regiment mentioned among the slain was an acquaintance
of Mr. Montagu’s, and a great friend of Mr.
Spencer’s. There are two Captains killed and regretted
of Guise’s Regiment, the same corps in which my
brother has a company. By good fortune he was not
there, being just returned from Flanders, and this Day
upon the Establishment as engineer, and ordered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
attend Marshal Wade. We may once more call the
east wind a Protestant wind. Had the English and
Dutch forces, amounting to 12,000 men, been kept off by
contrary winds, God only knows what the consequences
of the loss of this, in itself trifling, skirmish might
have been. As it is the Stocks have fallen considerably.
There has been a run upon the Bank, who have
paid silver to gain time, and have been much blamed for
so doing. But on the other hand, just reasons are
alledged for their conduct. They say they had certain
knowledge that those who began the run were disaffected
persons, who, if they had been paid in gold,
might with much greater facility have transmitted
supplies to Scotland, than when paid in silver. However
this may be, it is certain that some of the most
considerable Bankers and Merchants have agreed to
support the Bank on this occasion. I am still hopeful,
notwithstanding all the bad rumours we hear, that the
old English spirit, though confessedly sunk in deep
slumbers for many years, may yet awake. Can anything
be more ridiculous and more joyful to the French, more
terrible and more shameful to ourselves, to see a Nation
which might raise 500,000 men, a nation worth twice
500 millions of property, frightened and disordered by
5000 Highland ruffians not worth £5000, if they, their
wives and children, servants, goods and chattels, were
to be sold in the market? In the days of Oliver six
times that number were near Dunbar dispersed by
10,000 English like chaff before the wind. But perhaps,
as Voltaire says, ‘<span lang="fr">Les anglois d’aujourd’huy ne resemblent

be 10 or 12,000 strong. The Rendezvous it’s said, is to
be at Nottingham. I wish the Duke<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381">[381]</a> were sent for to
command. He behaved incomparably well in Flanders,
avoided no danger, no fatigue, was an example of regularity
and discipline, and what is more considerable, of
justice in rewarding merit. More troops are said to be
ordered over. This is certainly a right step, but the
consequences on the other side of the water, be what
they will.... We have a report that the Castle of
Edinburgh must soon surrender for want of provisions.
What an unpardonable neglect! If this should be so,
the consequences would be very bad, as it would furnish
the rebels with considerable quantities of cash, plate,

<p class="para1">“Since my last letter to you by Sunday’s Post,
we had our meeting at York on Tuesday the 24th, where
there was the greatest Meeting of peoples of all Ranks
and degrees that j believe was ever known upon any
occasion. Of the nobility there was present the Lord
Carlisle,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383">[383]</a> the Lord Malton,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384">[384]</a> Lord Lonsdale,<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385">[385]</a> Lord Falconbridge,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386">[386]</a>
Lord Fitzwilliam,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387">[387]</a> and perhaps some others
who may have escaped my notice, together with Sir
Conyers D’Arcy,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388">[388]</a> Mr. Turner, Member for the County,
Mr. Fox and Mr. Wentworth, members for the City of
York, and all the gentlemen of the County, together with
the clergy. There was the utmost unanimity and spirit
imaginable, and after a meeting at the Castle, where the
Archbishop made a handsome speech on the occasion,
an association was entered into with an address to the
King, and subscription made of near £20,000, and which
when the whole of the collection shall be made, will j
believe amount to much more. With this money there
are to be raised several Companys of foot, consisting of
50 men each, and they will be officered by gentlemen who
will serve without any pay, among whom is my friend,
Sir R. Graham, but it will be some time before these
companys can be raised, and made usefull, which would
not have been otherwise, if the Militia had been kept up
and exercised as the law directs instead of being ridiculed
and rendered contemptible these last fifty years for purposes
j need not tell you. I wish this misfortune would
for the future learn us more prudence, and make us settle
the Militia which is the only constitutional force, and
agreeable to our liberty, upon a better footing than it
has of late been, but j know too much of mankind ever
to hope to see it in this country. This rebellion has
made a most rapid and surprising progress. Edinburgh
was taken before it was believed there was almost any
such thing. The disbelief, however, of the people was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>no excuse for the M(inistr)y, whose measures have been
the cause of it, for not crushing it at the beginning.
The conduct of our General Cope is much censured for
suffering himself to be surprised by the enemy, who in
a short time overcame, and j wish Wentworth who is
sent may have better success than he had at Carthagena.
Mr. Ridley, the Mayor of Newcastle, has taken all proper
precautions to secure the town, and if we are rightly
informed, has, with the promise of £10,000, gained all
the Keel men, who are computed at 15,000 men. The
county of Durham has raised the Militia and General
Oglethorpe<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389">[389]</a> is at York raising a regiment of gentlemen
volunteers. About 15,000 Dutch are j believe got to
Berwick, and j hope we shall soon have the regiments
amounting to upwards of 6000, which are lately landed in
the Thames from Holland, by means of all which force j
flatter myself a speedy end will be put to this unhappy
affair, and peace restored to our Island....</p>

<p>“I desire you will not let yourself be concerned more
than you ought at these unhappy times, nor imagine us
here in greater danger than we really are, for if the
enemy should be for coming this length, we should have
notice enough of it, and as we are at present unprovided
with force, must take to flight to save ourselves. I am
in very good health and spirits, and run no hazards but
what others as deserving and better than j do run, and
hope your good sense and greatness of mind will preserve
you from being more concerned than other people
are, or you ought to be. I desire you will add to all
the other testimonys of your love and affection to me,

<p>On September 30, from London, George Lewis Scott

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since my last I have seen two Officers, who were
in the engagement of Saturday sen’night, and I have had
a pretty distinct account of our dispositions, so that I
could send you a plan of that affair.... It seems agreed
both by these officers and by the General’s letter that
our men were seized with a panic at the rapid motion of
the Highlanders, so that their officers attempted to rally
them in vain. The military Chest and all the baggage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>was taken, what the loss of men is cannot yet be known.
I find Captain Stewart is not killed, but only taken
Prisoner. Our civil panic here begins to subside a little.
General Wade’s<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390">[390]</a> Army will probably be near Doncaster
by this day sen’night, so that we hope Yorkshire will be
protected.... We are in no apprehensions for Berwick
or Newcastle: nor is the Castle of Edinburgh in danger
for want of provisions. Besides the ordinary Stores,
the Governor swept all the Markets in town, the day
the Rebels left it to meet General Cope. The Provost,
I hear, is in the Castle, so that I hope he will be able to
wipe off the aspersions so liberally thrown upon him.
There is no certain news of the further motions or
schemes of the Rebels. To-day I was told they intended
to march for Northumberland, and expected to be there
increased 10,000 men besides £100,000 in money. I give
no great credit to my author’s intelligence, he is of a
suspected family and speaks as he wishes. This is all
I have been able to pick up for you, and I hope your
fears begin to subside a little. But if I endeavour to
diminish them for the North I shall now on the contrary
try to increase them on the South. I mean as to your
going to Mount Morris. I saw a Sussex gentleman
yesterday, who tells me they are frequently alarmed by
Privateers on their coast, and what should hinder a few
desperadoes from landing in the night and doing as they
pleased on the coast.... I own it would give me a vast
satisfaction to see you and Miss Robinson in Dover Street
again.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR JOHN COPE</div>

<p>On October 5 George Lewis Scott wrote to Mrs.
Montagu, then at Mount Morris, a long letter, a portion
of which I copy. His handwriting, though small, was
clear and exceedingly elegant. He chaffs her and Miss
Robinson at taking refuge near the sea, and says, “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
I were Captain of a Privateer, and had 50 stout fellows
to second me, I would carry you and your whole family
off in spite of the unconquered county of Kent.”...
After this he suggests</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“a vidette, a Sentinel on Horseback at a proper distance
from the house, who may gallop home and give you
timely allarm, your horses should be ready saddled....
The Army under Marshal Wade is not to rendezvous at
Worcester till the 12th instant. If the Highlanders have
begun their march as it is supposed, and that their Chiefs
get their men to cross the borders, (no easy task, because
of the prevailing tradition among them that none ever
get back again), they may be in Yorkshire as soon as
our Army. I am sorry that county is not better prepared,
but alas! it is not easy to be prepared in a country
rendered so artificially unwarlike as England. What
signify all the speeches of the Orators, or rather of
our ignorant, perhaps knavish babblers in Parliament
against the Army? What has been the consequence of
their insisting so often, contrary to common experience
and common sense, that our Navy was a sufficient
security. They only misled honest gentlemen. Their
frothy words will not restore tranquillity, and public
credit, nor repel the Highlanders. The Roman orators
were also warriors, even Cicero was, I believe, a better
General than most of ours, who have not forgot the Art
of War, as Miss Robinson suggests: they never <em>learnt</em> it.</p>

<p>“<i>À propos</i> of Generals, the following lines were
made and repeated by a lady while asleep; her husband
set them down, and astonished her with them in the

<p>Mr. Montagu now proposed returning from the
North, thinking matters were on a better footing, and
intended fetching his wife from Mount Morris, but
Parliament being summoned, was forced to remain in
Dover Street. Mrs. Montagu proposed joining him
from Kent on October 27. In a letter to him on the
25th, she states, “The smugglers here are all patriots
it seems, which is very fortunate, for they assemble in
formidable numbers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson being threatened with a renewal
of cancer in her breast, was persuaded to accompany
Mrs. Montagu to London for advice. In a letter to
the Duchess of Portland at this period Mrs. Montagu
states—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The learned faculty have given us better hopes of
my Mother’s case than I could have expected. They
say it is not yet cancerous, and that it may be many
years before it hurts her. Your Grace was excessively
good in sending me the receipts which I have sent her,
and also the Walnut medicine.”</p>

duchess, appears to have been made of the lining of

<div class="sidenote">MR. SCOTT’S APPETITE</div>

<p>In a letter to Sarah of November 8 Mrs. Montagu
jokes about Mr. Scott being in love with Sarah, but his
appetite being little diminished by it, as he had just
eaten most of a chine of mutton and two large apple
dumplings. He seems from other letters to have
possessed a large appetite! She then adds—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think it is time to tell you all the news I have

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I received your Grace’s commands by express
yesterday morning by six o’clock. I immediately wrote
a letter to old Mr. Squire and his son, and expected an
answer last night, but to my surprise John Goodwin
came in without one, they being both in Huntingdonshire,
and I expect every minute an answer which was
promised by Mr. Squire. Mr. George Robinson I
waited upon, and he expressed great satisfaction at
your Grace’s kind favour of being made Captain Lieutenant
in your Grace’s own troop of Horse, and returns
your Grace his most dutiful thanks for the same.
Your Grace is pleased to mention that the new rais’d
Regiment will soon march northwards, at which both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
regiments have expressed much uneasiness: the men
say they had no need to leave their houses and families
to go for soldiery, that they and their forefathers have
lived quietly and happily under your Grace and your
forefathers as tenants for hundreds of years, that they
would never have engaged to the Wars with anybody
but your Grace, when they listed it was only to go along
with your Grace to fight for you, and that they would
go with nobody else. The Northamptonshire men are
in the same story, they say if they had wanted to quit
their professions to be soldiers they might have had five
pounds a man to list in the Guards, or four pounds a
man to list in a marching regiment, but they chose to
list with your Grace for nothing, out of regard for you,
and to go with you and fight for you, and nobody else.
I believe one reason which made the people more
uneasy is, that at the time they were raising, it was
maliciously insinuated amongst them that your Grace’s
name was only made use of to get them to list, and that
they would be draughted and turned over to other
Colonels, which made many backward in listing, and
many of them are still apprehensive of being serv’d
so, and declare if they are, they will sooner venture
being shot for deserters than serve, and it has cost us
much pains and many good words and a great deal of
coaxing to bring them into temper; and we have told
them that in fighting in defence of their King and
country, wherever your Grace shall order them is the
true way of serving your Grace, and that they may be
assured they will not be draughted and turned over to
other Colonels, and they seem now to be pretty easy
for the present, and I believe, will march chearfully
and willingly enough, when and wherever your Grace
shall please to order them. Give me leave, my dear
Lord Duke, once more to offer myself and fifty men,
quite volunteers, to bear our own expenses, to wait
on your Grace, if you must expose your person to
danger, wherever you shall please to command us, and
cloath ourselves in what manner you like best, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>

stay any longer for Mr. Squire’s answer. I dare venture

<p>A letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess of Portland,

<div class="sidenote">CATTLE MURRAIN</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Carlisle is surrendered to the rebels, who, I hear,
behave civilly, and not as conquerors.... Ligonier is
still ill; the Dukes of Richmond and Bedford are set
out. Lord Sandwich is aide-de-camp to the Duke of
Richmond. I pity poor Lady Sandwich, she endeavours
to bear up, but certainly she is in an uneasy situation;
I saw her on Sunday, and she is to dine here to-morrow....

<p>“My Father, you are to understand, is not at all concerned,

he has ordered everything to be packed up that can be
packed.” She adds, “I don’t know that the French will
invade us, but I am sure crossness has, and my Father
is just miserably out of sorts, so it’s a pity but he should
stay in the house, he would presently scold the French
away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INVASION EXPECTED —<br>
THE LAW REGIMENT</div>

<p>The Montagus had now left London for Sandleford,
and Mr. George L. Scott writes the following letter to
Mr. Montagu:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“London, December 12, 1745.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I did not expect so sudden an occasion of
writing to you. You need not, however, expect very
important news, it being only to inform you that henceforward
you may shine in the dignity of F.R.S., you
were elected this evening, and may be admitted when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
you return to town. We had a very hot alarm this
morning, of a descent of the French in Sussex. It was
grounded upon a letter of a gentleman of distinction in
your county; the Secretary of the Customs roused Mr.
Pelham with the news at three, but a more certain and
contradictory account came by eight, with us the report
subsisted till two, and then vanished. Thus far, they
say, may be depended on, that Dunkirk Harbour is filled
with Ships. If the French can get a footing in Kent, it
will be their fault if they do not do us inconceivable
damages by destroying our docks, and raising heavy
contributions. Were it not for some individuals, and
innocent persons who would suffer on such an occasion,
I should not grieve in the least to see some others pay
the penalty of their infatuation or dastardly spirit. I
only wish the King’s forces might be strong enough to
take the booty from the French, and divide it among
themselves; this would be no loss to the nation, and
only transfer property from the fools or cowards to
the brave. I say the same of the Northern counties,
through which the Rebels have passed. They have
behaved infamously. Sullivan, who was in Corsica
with Marshal Maillebois,<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400">[400]</a> has now felt the difference
between modern Englishmen and Corsicans, much
to the honour of the latter. These poor people, undisciplined
and unarmed, almost with any thing but
the spirit of liberty, baffled two veteran armies. Here
a country more extensive than Corsica, better peopled,
richer, and either well armed, or such as might have
been so if they pleased, and with-all well furnished
with plenty of horses, has tamely suffered itself to
be overrun by a pack of foot banditti, two-thirds of
which, by the best accounts, are scarce men, <i lang="la">pudet hæc
opprobria</i>!</p>

<p>“Our accounts from Scotland are but melancholy.
The Rebels lay what contributions they please. Some
Clans, they say, have taken arms, not with any intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
to assist either side, but only to plunder. It is now at
last agreed upon to bring over the Hessians. What a
shame that we should want them! and what a shame
that since any man might see we did want them, they
were not brought over sooner. I say the same of the
remainder of our country. Our administration puts me
in mind of the rustic mentioned by Demosthenes, who
coming into a fencing school, never foresaw a blow, but
as soon as he was pushed, he would then clap his hand
to the place, and so shift it after another blow, being
thus always too late.</p>

<p>“Our law regiment received his Majesty’s thanks
much about the time you left this on Tuesday, with an
intimation that the rebels being retired, he was unwilling
to put us to any further trouble or expense. The
frustrating this scheme is placed to the account of the
mean jealousy of a certain great man. His family, I
hear, on the other hand complain that he should be
reproached on this head, when he was totally ignorant
of the whole affair, and his being at all mentioned in it,
was entirely owing to the indiscretion and impertinent
zeal of some silly young fellows, who might fancy to
obtain his favour by their conduct on this occasion, but
what he totally disapproves of. What the truth of the
matter is I know not, but I have my own suspicions,
which possibly I may find an opportunity to verify. If
they prove true, all I can say is I would not have some
men’s souls for their estates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fears of a French invasion increased
in the southern counties, as will be seen by this letter
of Mrs. Robinson’s to Mrs. Montagu—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“December 15, 1745.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“Before you receive this you will have heard
from Sally that she this day sett forward for Cantʸ, in
order to proceed for London to-morrow morning: indeed
the frequent alarms we have had for this last week
has been too much for her spirits, and I pressed her to
go, for she was not able to make herself easy in staying,
and yet, poor girl, she went with great heaviness, though
she had a mind to it, and Mr. Robinson, though he
thought the fright more than necessary, was very easy
with it. Yesterday he had a certain account from Dover
that Admiral Vernon sent yᵐ an express last Tuesday,
yt he had reason to believe yt ye French design’d landing
a great force (it was said 200,000, though yt, I think,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>must be a mistake) at Dover, or on the Kentish coast,
and ordered them to keep themselves in readiness to
oppose them: 400 men keep watch at nights, and ye
inhabitants keep all their best effects packed up to send
away at ye first approach of danger. These things
much magnified, and told in many different shapes, are
sufficient to alarm most people that live where we do,
for should any army land on ye coast of Kent, I am told
Romney<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404">[404]</a> is the most convenient place, as there is a
fine flat to land on, and no opposition can be made, as
we are destitute of forces, and the people entirely unarmed
and frightened out of their wits: we are in the
worst situation of any gentleman’s house in the county
in such a case, for they must pass within two or three
fields<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405">[405]</a> of ye house, if not through the yard, and you
know we stand very visible, yt in such case, which God
forbid, we must be great sufferers, they wou’d certainly
spoil what they cou’d not carry away, and probably set
fire to the house. But as to our selves, I don’t doubt
but we are as safe as the rest of the Nation, for we have
given orders for an express to come away if any landing
appears in ye Marsh, and should set out in an hour’s
time, whereas an army would be some days in landing.
Nor am I in any fright, no do I believe they dare attempt
any such thing, but that ye transports that lay manᵉᵈ at
Dunkirk are designed to land some forces in Scotland,
of wcʰ two was taken, and broᵗ into Deal yesterday,
bound for Montrose, and I think Suffolk would be a
better place yⁿ ye Kentish coast, and less guarded: but
I will tell you what I have done by way of precaution.
I have packed up all ye lining, plate and Clothes yt
cou’d be spared from constant use, and all writings,
and they are ready loaded in the waggon, and secured
tennants’ horses to carry them off. As to furniture, it
may take its fate, as I cou’d neither put it up properly,
nor get carriages to carry it off on ye sudden, and it
wou’d be great expence, and great damage to do it to no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
purpose. Pray don’t be in any fright for us, for you
may be sure we shall take care of ourselves so far as
not to be caught, and that is all anybody can do. I shall
be greatly concern’d shou’d such a thing happen, for our
own misfortune and those of everybody’s else, for ye
whole nation must be sufferers, though some may feel
it in a more particular manner than others, as they wou’d
be more in ye way of these people. I am much at ease
yt Sally is gone, as a sudden alarm might have affected
her so as to have highten’d my fright, wʰ wou’d have
been more for her than for myself. There is orders
come to ye Deputy Lieutenants to raise ye Militia, we
hear yt the Dutch Ships with Admiral Vernon sail’d this
afternoon northwards, by which we hope ye fears of this
part grow less, or he wou’d not lessen his forces.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pray is the young man who you once proposed to
me for a servant at liberty now? For my footman
thinks my wages not equal to his parts and merits.
The servant I part with, is very honest, but I cannot
bring him to deliver his sincerity in such delicate terms
as are necessary in a message. He told a lady of quality
who inquired after my health, that I was <em>pure stout</em>, and
if I am in good spirits he tells people I am <em>brave</em>, that
he is likely to establish me as a character of violence....
If your youth can carry a message, keep himself sober
and clean, and stay at home, when he is not sent abroad,
they are all the qualifications I desire. He is to have
livery, and frock every year, and six pounds wages the
first year, the second seven. He is to put out his
washing.”</p>

<p>Greater threatenings than ever of an invasion arose

expectation that the Pretender would arrive at some

<div class="sidenote">THE DEATH OF MRS. ROBINSON</div>

<p>At the end of April, or commencement of May, Mrs.
Montagu lost her excellent and amiable mother from a
return of her former illness. I have no letters till the
following one, undated, in reply for a letter of condolence
of Mrs. Freind’s:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“The tender hand of a friend does all in the
power of human art to heal the wounds given by affliction.
That you love me, and interest yourself for me,
must on all occasions give me comfort. It is not consistent
with duty or prudence to be ever considering
one’s loss with those circumstances of tenderness that
make one unable to bear up against it, so I will say as
little as possible of the dear, tender parent, and endeavour
to recollect her only as a most excellent woman,
and try to become good by her example. She concluded
with an heroic constancy the most virtuous life. From
her prosperity she drew arguments of resignation and
patience, and expressed the greatest thankfulness that
Providence had lent her so many blessings without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
repining that they were to be taken away. How few
are they that do not grow proud and stubborn by that
indulgence which made her humble and resigned! She
had spent her life in doing those just, right things that
bring peace at the last; and after living so many years
in the world, left it with the greatest innocence of soul
and integrity of heart I ever knew. How much superior
is this to the forced and immeritorious innocence of a
sequestered Cloister; for after having bent to all the
duties of human life, she had not contracted any of the
vices or bad affections of it; nor had she the least tincture
of the secret faults of malice or envy which often
lurk about the hearts of those who are esteemed persons
of unblameable conduct. Through every action of her
life she deserved to be loved and esteemed, and in her
death almost to be adored, for in that scene she appeared
almost more than human. But this subject is too affecting,
nor can I think of my final separation from such a
friend with the resignation I ought.</p>

<p>“I beg you would think favourably of a journey to
Sandleford: you cannot imagine the pleasure it would
give me to see you there. We are still roasting in this
dusty town, but hope a very few days will carry us into

<p class="para1">“If your knowing how sensible I am of your
loss of my dear Aunt, and how deeply I share in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
affliction, could afford you any relief, I should endeavour
to lay open a most sorrowful Heart to you, tho’ I could
send you but a faint copy of it, for my grief, like yours,
is at present too big for utterance. I can offer nothing
for your consolation, but what I’m sure your own
thoughts will have suggested to you; that the Dear,
the Valuable Parent you have lost has lived to enjoy
the Greatest Blessing a parent can have, the seeing her
children brought up in health and prosperity; that she
who acted so strictly up to her duty in every capacity
here is only removed from the Happiness she reap’d in
her Family, to receive the further and infinitely greater
Reward of her well-doing; that since the Giver of Life
saw fit to finish hers by so painful a Distemper, it is
some comfort that her Misery was of no longer
duration.</p>

<p>“From these considerations I am persuaded you will
find all the consolation that such an affliction can admit
of. Your letter is dated the 5th, but it did not reach
me till the last post, and had the Dublin postmark on it.
I had received the melancholy news from Lady Suffolk,
but could not write to you immediately upon your misfortune.
The news of my poor Aunt’s Death is a heavy
addition to such a load of sorrow as I was before nearly
ready to sink under. My eldest girl has lately discovered
some tendency to my asthmatical Disorder;
the Thought that she received this from me, and that
the rest of my dear Babes stand the same unhappy
chance, is such an affliction to me....</p>

<p>At this period Lord Andover presented the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>

with a constant succession of company, whilst their
father, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Robert Lumley, was alive. Reduced to
poverty by his death, they both married men of small
fortune, therefore one is not surprised that Lydia
Botham, unaccustomed to small means, and, in spite of
her delicacy, extremely fond of society, soon incurred
debt and embarrassment with a growing family and
small income.</p>

<p>Lady Andover, who was her constant and best friend,
writes on June 26 to Mrs. Montagu to explain the excessive
melancholy of Lydia, who was proceeding that week
to Albury. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The blame they lay upon themselves for having
lived beyond their circumstances and the sense of
having injured their children, of whom they are most
tender, is a reflection sufficient to bring a person of

a great share in her sufferings....”</p>

should hope it was in his power to do them some good,
but then Alas! poor Johnny is such a Johnny that there
arises all the difficulty of getting them any preferment.
Lydia also is so blind to all his defects that the least
disrespectful thought of Johnny would make her more
than ever miserable.” She continues to say, “Any
exchange from Staffordshire must be advantageous to
them, for there, as they unfortunately began with entering
into all the expenses that attend a great neighbourhood,
they could never have lived in the way they
intend doing and may do here.... This place is but

<div class="sidenote">THE “LITTLE PÈRE”</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu was much distressed by the poor boy
employed in her garden at Sandleford having accidentally
fallen into a pond there and been drowned,
an account of which she writes to the duchess on
August 7. In this letter she begs the duchess to
send the “Little Père,” as he was fondly called (Dr.
Courayer), to stay with her, from Bullstrode, where
he had been domiciled some time. At the same time
she asks for two peacocks, “After asking for Dr.
Courayer to beg your two peacocks, are there in
Nature things that differ like this Philosopher and the
bird of noise, vanity, and ostentation?” The peacocks
were to console a white pea-hen at Sandleford for the
loss of her mate, a white peacock, which, together
with a quantity of poultry, had been stolen by the
bargemen of Newbury. The Montagus sent a party
of armed servants to inspect the barges, but only
feathers and eggs were discovered. The peacocks were
duly conveyed by waggon to the “Windmill,” Slough,
whence the Newbury waggoner, Sandy, conveyed
them to Sandleford. The duchess, in writing about
them, adds, “Lord Cromartie is pardoned; the King
sent for my Lady to acquaint him with it. Was
not that doing it in the most tender, compassionate
manner?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan was at this time at Tunbridge, at
Lord Percival’s house, and Mrs. Montagu jokingly confided
her father, Mr. Robinson, who was there, to her
care. On August 5 Mrs. Donnellan writes to say of
Mr. Robinson, “I can assure you he is in very good
widower’s spirits.” She adds, “He has lent me his
chariot daily to carry me home at night to Lord
Percival’s.” Mrs. Donnellan waited at Tunbridge till
the death of her friend, Sir Robert Sutton,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 412">[412]</a> which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>

roots. Evidently “Lydia” was not a notable housekeeper,
as she also instructs her in the art of keeping a
weekly account book, and entering in it every item of
expense. The duchess was anxious for the Montagus
to go to Bullstrode, but the visit was deferred, as the
three younger Robinsons were spending their holidays
at Sandleford, and the captain and Morris Robinson
expected Mr. and Mrs. Freind there as well. Poor old
Mr. Carter, the steward, was just dead of fever, which,
it was thought, he caught when on agent’s work at
Newcastle, where fever had been rife amongst the unhappy
prisoners of the ’45 confined there. He was

<p>The curious remedies of the period are shown in a
letter of Mrs. Botham, of November 25, where she says
she has been taking <em>Elixir of Vitriol</em> for her asthma, and
is now going to try <em>Tar Water</em>, then supposed to be
a universal medicine. She adds that the Glebelands,
sixty acres in extent at Albury, had been let for £17 a
year for thirty years, but as no one bid “Johnny” more,
he was now farming it himself, as it provides our family
with “grain, fowls, bacon, milk, butter and eggs.”</p>

have no great expectations of the comedy, for Dr.

the pitch of his muse, and with what dignity his buskins

<p>An undated letter of Mrs. Montagu’s to the Duchess

She says—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am this instant from the play, where I have been

<div class="sidenote">YOUNG EDWARD WORTLEY MONTAGU</div>

<p>Two curious letters to Mr. Montagu from his
eccentric young cousin, Edward Wortley Montagu,
occur next. He was the only son of Mr. Montagu’s
first cousin, Edward Wortley Montagu, whose father,
Sidney Montagu, was the second son of the great
Earl of Sandwich. Sidney Montagu married Anne,
daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Wortley, and
assumed the name of Wortley. By her he had one
son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who married Lady
Mary Pierpoint, daughter of Evelyn, Duke of Kingston;
they had two children, Edward, born in 1713, and Mary,
born 1718, who married John, Earl of Bute. To give
young Wortley Montagu’s eccentric life here would
take too much space, but the reader will find an epitome
of it at the end of this work. In 1745, he was in
the Army through the influence of his relation, the
Duke of Montagu, had been through the campaign, and
was present at the Battle of Fontenoy. He became a
prisoner of war, but was shortly before the date of
the first letter exchanged, and, coming to England, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
given, by the Earl of Chesterfield,<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 424">[424]</a> a commission to
carry a packet of important papers to his relation, Lord
Sandwich,<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 425">[425]</a> being informed of the contents of them in
case he was waylaid and robbed. Mr. Montagu had
always acted a kind part towards his young cousin,
and frequently interceded for him with his father, old
Wortley Montagu, in his endless escapades, which were
enough to try any parent’s heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACTION IN HOLLAND</div>

<p>As the letters are of interminable length, I only
quote portions of them. In the first, from Harwich,
April 22, becalmed <i>en route</i> for the Army, he begs Mr.
Edward Montagu to recommend him to the Duke of
Montagu as messenger to the Court of Prussia, whither
he heard a despatch was to be sent. He alludes to his
father having visited Lord Chesterfield to ask about
him, as they were not on speaking terms then, though
his father was at the same time anxious he should
enter Parliament. The second letter is from Ter Goes,
May 15, 1747 (N.S.)—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We sailed from Harwich with the wind contrary,
and were two pacquets in company. We were attacked
by a privateer of 16 guns and got clear of him after a
combat of between four and five hours. As soon as I
arrived at Helvoet, I went immediately to the Hague,
staid one day there, and then went on to H.R.H.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 426">[426]</a> with a
pacquet from Lord Sandwich; the moment the Duke
saw me he told me I was released, and ordered me to
take post and join my regiment. The moment I got to
the regiment, I found it retreating from the French,
having lost between two and three hundred men and
about 10 officers killed or wounded; our Major is among
the former. When we got to the seaside we did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
find vessels enough to embark us all, so our regiment,
as the eldest, embarked the last, but when all Braggs’
and most of the Highlanders were got off, we and the
remainder of them were attacked by a body of 1200.
They were so well received that they quitted us, after
having lost three officers and about twenty-seven men.
We lost only one officer and a very few men. Billanders
came just then, and we got off very luckily, for had
we staid ten minutes longer we should all have been
killed or taken, for we were scarce on board when we
saw a considerable body march to the ground we had
been on....”</p>

<p>Lord Sandwich gave Mr. Montagu £500 towards his
election expenses. Young Wortley Montagu was trying
for Parliament at the same time, and was returned, and
Matthew Robinson was seeking election for Canterbury.</p>

<p>On June 23 Mrs. Montagu writes her last letter
from Dover Street to her husband: “I am now on
the point of leaving this town and my disfurnished
house.... Please to send to the Crown Inn for a box,
in which I have sent your frock with the gold loops.
My brother does not meet with any opposition.”</p>

<p>The Hill Street house being still unfinished, Mrs.
Montagu went to Sandleford, accompanied by Mrs.
Donnellan, previously securing a room for her husband
in town, “my Father’s lodgings at Mrs. Cranwell’s in
Shepheard Street, near Red Lion Square.”</p>

<p>On June 30 Mr. Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My Dearest, it is with great pleasure that j can

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Writing to the duchess on July 6, Mrs. Montagu

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A few days ago I carried Mrs. Donnellan and the
little Père to see Mr. Sloper’s gardens<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 432">[432]</a> and house at a
time when I was assured he was absent on his election,
but seeing a man ride up the avenue at the same time, I
took it into my head it might be Mr. Sloper, so I did
not alight immediately. The housekeeper came to me
and asked if I would walk in; I said I should be glad to
see the house if Mr. Cibber was not at home; the
housekeeper looked aghast, as if she had spoilt a custard
or broke a jelly glass; I coloured, Mrs. Donnellan
tittered, Dr. Courayer sputtered, half French, half
English, and began to search for the case of a spying
glass I had dropt in my fright. As my organs of speech
rather than of sight, seemed defective, I was little
interested for my perspective, but sat in the coach
making melancholy reflections on my mistake. Mrs.
Donnellan could not compose her countenance, so that
we were near a quarter of an hour before we got out of
the coach; and after so long a pause I walked into the
house, greatly abashed.”</p>

<p>To understand this joke it must be explained that
Mrs. Theophilus Cibber,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 433">[433]</a> the celebrated actress, was
the mistress of Mr. Sloper. She had been forced into
marriage with Theophilus Cibber,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 434">[434]</a> son of “old Cibber,”
the celebrated actor, and her husband, who was a worthless
man, had connived at the connection. In a previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
letter of Mrs. Montagu’s, of 1744, mention is made of
a house at West Woodhay furnished by Mr. Sloper for
Mrs. Cibber “entirely in white satin.” A further
passage says—</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. COURAYER</div>

<p>“I believe I could shake your spleen with a description
of Dr. Courayer’s figure—when he arrived here
from Oxford through a whole day’s rain; but let it
suffice that he shone with drops of water like the
Diamond ficoides. How his beaver was slouched, his
coloured handkerchief twisted, and his small boots
stuck to his small legs; how the rain had uncurled his
wig, the spleen dejected his countenance, the cramp
spoiled his gait! not being much accustomed to riding
he was so fatigued and benumbed he could scarce walk,
that for so good a Christian he appeared surprizingly

Knight of the Shire of Huntingdon, described an
election ball. “Our ball last Monday was very brilliant.
We had a very elegant supper for near 200 people, and
finished by dancing till 6 in the morning.” He mentions
“my friend untieing his purse strings with the greatest
reluctance, and was very peevish to see so many people
at Supper, which he thinks very unwholesome.” This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
is probably old Wortley, his father. A christening of
one of Lady Sandwich’s children had just taken place.
Mrs. Montagu was godmother by proxy. “I assure
you I wished the real Godmothers had been there
instead of the substitutes.” Then stating Lord Sandwich
had left so hastily they did not know if he had
arranged for venison for the races, he begs Mr. Montagu

of a prodigious hill, where there is not a drop of water
nor a stick of wood; he has planted some fir trees
which are watered every day by carts that bring the
water about three miles; he has sunk a well to the
centre of the earth, from whence some laborious horses
draw him as much water as may wash his face, or in a
liberal hour supply his tea kettle. The winds plays
about his house in so riotous a manner, that a person
must poise themselves in a very exact manner to maintain
their ground and walk on two legs with an erect
countenance as it is the glory and pride of human nature
to do.... The first house this gentleman built was in
a bottom, where the ground was all wet and marshy,
overgrown with willows and alders and extremely
peopled with frogs; there he found himself ill at ease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>

THE AXLETREE</div>

<p>In the next letter of August 23 is the description of
Lady Fane’s grotto—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The situation is, like most grottoes, placed where a
grotto would not be looked for: it joins to the house.
Now having told its only defect, I will go on to the rest.
The first room is fitted up entirely with shells, the sides
and ceiling in beautiful mosaic, a rich cornice of flowers
in baskets and cornucopias, and the little yellow sea
snail is so disposed in shades as to resemble knots of
ribbon which seem to tye up some of the bunches of
flowers. There is a bed for the Hermit, which is composed
of rich shells, and so shaded that the curtain
seems folded and flowing.... The room adjoining it is
the true and proper style for a grotto; it is composed of
rough rock work in a very bold taste, the water falls
down it into a cold bath. This grotto is about 50 yards
from the Thames, to which the descent is very precipitate.
From the Shell Room you have no advantage of
the Thames, from the other room you have a view of it.
The House to which this grotto is joined is a small
habitation where Lady Fane used to pass a good deal
of time. Lord Fane’s seat<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 437">[437]</a> is about a mile from it: it
has not indeed the view of the Thames, but is finely
situated in a bower of Beech Wood, and before it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
pretty prospect. From the Grotto we went to a Wood
by the Thames, where we sat and eat our cold dinner
very comfortably. In the afternoon we walked up a
hill which commands a fine prospect, the Thames winds
about in the manner it does at Cliefden. There is a
want of wood, as I think the country rather flat, but
the prospect is very extensive; you see Oxford and
Reading, one on the right, the other on the left hand.
In our road thither one of the wheels took fire and
burnt thro’ the axletree.... A wheelwright was apply’d
to but he had been carousing at a christening, and was
not in that degree of sober sense requisite to make even
an axletree. A Justice of the peace whom the King had
knighted lived hard by; to him we applyed for a coach,
as it was part of his office to send vagrants to the place
of their abode. Alas! his coach, which contrary to
other things used to rest on the week days and work
only on the Sabbath, had not been licensed, to the great
inconvenience of his lady and the grief of Carter John,
who one day in the week was a coachman.... What
was to be done? The sun was declining, we were 20
miles from home.... A good inn with the sign of the
Blue Boar, Green Dragon, or Red Lion would have
pleased us better than all we had seen, but—Alas! the
only village within reach offered us a homely lodging
under thatched roofs. We were a party of seven, and
might have stormed the village with more ease than the
French can Bergen-op-Zoom, but the plunder w’d not
have given us a supper, or the place afforded us a
lodging. But on finding the uncoached Justice was
married to Sir Robert Sutton’s niece,<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 438">[438]</a> an acquaintance
of Mrs. Donnellan’s, she sent her compliments, told our
distress, and we were kindly received that night. The
wheelwright slept himself sober, the next day made
us an axletree, and we came home laughing at our
adventures.”</p>

<p>The Montagus had projected a tour to Southampton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
for some time, and towards the end of August they set
out, accompanied by Dr. Courayer, leaving Jack and
William Robinson at Sandleford. Writing to the
duchess on September 22, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We went from hence to Winchester, where we saw
the Cathedral, attending Service on Sunday; it is a very
neat Gothick building in so good repair that time seems
rather to have made it venerable than old. The Choir
is very handsome, there are many old monuments.
Several of the Saxon Kings have their bones collected
into a sort of Trunk.... William Rufus is interred
there too, in a kind of stone chest; William of Wickham
and Cardinal Beaufort bear their ensigns of the
Prelatick order on their tombs, which are very handsome;
but let us leave the pride of the dead for the
luxury of the living, and go on to Mr. Dummer’s.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 439">[439]</a> The
gardens are pretty, and there is a fine lawn before the
house, from whence there is a rich prospect and a distant
sight of the river at Southampton, where we arrived
pretty late in the evening. The next morning we surveyed
the town, which I think is very pretty, but what
most pleased me there, was the prospect from a little
Round Tower from which one has the finest view
imaginable, the sea and river most encompass it....
From hence we went to Mount Bevis;<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 440">[440]</a> your Grace
knows it so well I shall not describe it.... What a
noble Bason does the river form at the end of the
Bowling Green! how fine a prospect from the Mount!
Lord Peterborough<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 441">[441]</a> says in a letter to Mr. Pope in
reference to Mount Bevis, ‘I confess the lofty Sacharissa
at Stowe, but am content with my little Amoret.’
His Lordship had great reason to be content, for tho’
Stowe, like a court beauty, is adorn’d and ornamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
with great expence, the native graces of Mount Bevis
surprize and charm the beholder, and have an effect that
art can never reach.... We spent a good deal of time
in these charming gardens: went from them to Lyndhurst,
one of the King’s houses in the New Forest, which
house the Duke of Bedford lends to Mr. Medows.”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 442">[442]</a></p>

<p>“In a room on this Mount, Pope used to write, and
I imagine he wrote his ‘Universal Prayer’ there, for the
unbounded prospect leads the mind to the Great Author
of all things, and to say to Him, ‘Whose Temple has
all space, &amp;c.’ There is a little recess in the wood
where he used to study, and here perhaps he meditated
his satires, for we are most apt to blame the crowd
when we ourselves are out of the Tumult.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW FOREST —<br>
WILTON&thinsp;—&thinsp;
SAVERNAKE</div>

<p>At Lyndhurst the Medowses took their guests to
see the Forest—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“saw Burleigh and Bolder Lodges, the one belongs to
the Duke of Bolton, the other to Lord Delawarre. Saw
the Forest, where there are (after great depredations),
still some fine trees remaining.... Went one day to
Hurst Castle, which commands a full view of the Isle of
Wight; we dined on our cold loaf in the room where
King Charles was prisoner; it is a neat, strong castle
but small—Harry Bellardine is governor of it. Another
day we were carried to Beaulieu, a seat of the Duke of
Montagu’s, the wood and water make it the finest summer
situation imaginable. The house was part of an
old Abbey,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 443">[443]</a> and there are traces of the Monastery that
show it was large. We saw a fine prospect of the
River and Isle of Wight from a place called Exbury.
From Lyndhurst we went to Salisbury; on the Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
we went to the Cathedral and heard an excellent sermon
from the Bishop of Lincoln. We received great civilities
from the Bishop of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 444">[444]</a> and Mrs. Sherlock. I
cannot describe Wilton,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 445">[445]</a> it exceeds all that poetry and
painting can represent. A fine lawn leads you to a
charming river, on which there is a bridge, and such a
bridge!<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 446">[446]</a>... What sort of Bridge, say you? Why
such a bridge as the gods would build to lead the souls
of the Blessed from Lethe to Elysium if Charon would
permit it. This leads to a fine hill covered with Nature’s
verdant carpet adorned with fine plantations.... We
descended from this hill and crossed the river again
over another elegant building, and so returned to the
house. The apartments are very noble, the Statues and
busts are famous.... The rooms are very fine, and
there is one which exceeds any I ever saw and which
has in it the fine family piece by Vandyck; it really
exceeded my expectation, the figures are so finely
painted, their attitudes are gestures and their looks are
speech; there are many other fine pictures. From
Salisbury we directed our course to Stone Henge,
which is an astonishing thing.... Thence we went
to Amesbury,<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 447">[447]</a> where great improvements are making.
There is a little river which winds about so as to make
the place appear almost an island. There are three
pretty Bridges, one in the manner of a Chinese house.
The Duke of Queensborough has planted the hill very
prettily. The house was a hunting box, built by Inigo
Jones, the front handsome, the inside very small, only
one fine room.</p>

<p>“We got that night to Marlborough, early enough to
walk in Lord Hertford’s garden.... Lord Hertford
has made a pretty grotto.</p>

<p>Matthew Robinson had been returned member for
Canterbury with little opposition. In writing to her
father to press his visiting at Sandleford, Mrs. Montagu
begs him to leave his canvasses, but bring his
painting materials. “We will provide all possible conveniences
for your work, and you may create immortal
plants, clouds that will never dissolve in rain, nor be
chased by wind, and suns that shine larger than in the
miraculous days of Joshua.” She also thanks him for
<cite>Hoyle’s book on Chess</cite>, and <cite>Taylor’s on Perspective</cite>,

<p>Parliament being summoned for November 10, Mr.
Montagu set out, but very unwillingly, as his wife had
been suffering much from “spasms of the stomach,”
a complaint she was much plagued with. In a letter
of November 14 he promises to send a pamphlet on
Lord Lovat’s trial, and Mr. Lyttelton’s verses. This
latter was the celebrated <cite>Monody</cite> which he wrote
after the death of his first wife, <i>née</i> Lucy Fortescue,
who had died on January 19 of this year, leaving
him with two children—Thomas, afterwards 2nd Baron
Lyttelton, and Lucy, who married Arthur, Viscount
Valentia.</p>

<p>Mr. Montagu, accompanied by his neighbour, Mr.
Herbert, of Highclere, inspected his new house in Hill
Street, which was then being ornamented, and with
which he was not pleased. They then proceeded to see
Lord Chesterfield’s house, which was nearing completion.
He says “his principal apartment, which is
on the ground floor, will be very magnificent.”</p>

His treatise<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 454">[454]</a> on Gavelkind still continues to be the

duchess, says, “Whisk and the noble game of E. O.
employ the evening; three glasses of water, a toasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
roll, a Bath cake, and a cold walk the mornings,” but
the regimen agreed with her, and she accompanied
Mr. Montagu to Sandleford on May 1, leaving Sarah
Robinson, who was suffering from headache, with her
friend, Miss Grinfield, at Bath. From this period dates
the extreme intimacy which grew up between Miss
Robinson and Lady Barbara Montagu, sister of George
Montagu Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, who was then living
at Bath, and invited Miss Robinson to stay with her.</p>

<p>From the Middletons, Mrs. Montagu writes to Mrs.
Donnellan—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Cambridge, June 15.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“As I date my letter from the modern capital
of the Muses, you will perhaps expect that I should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>send you some strains of immortal poetry, but I have
not yet met with any such thing, and must rather give
an account of the Buildings than the literary works of
the University. I had some pleasure in the recollection
of the easy careless years of infancy, some part of which
I passed here with the most tender of relations, a fond
grandmother; in comparison of whose indulgence all
other indulgence is severity, as you must be sensible if
ever you had the greatest of infant comforts, a grandmother.
So much to my particular circumstances; then,
to the general situation of the University. The Colleges
do not in general, stand so as to give ornament to the
town, as those of Oxford, but if the town is the worse
for it, the Colleges are the better, as they open to the
fields, and from thence receive and give a fine prospect.
King’s College, Clare Hall, and Trinity Library, and
the finest of Gothick buildings—King’s College Chapel,
makes a beautiful appearance from the public walks.
Trinity College is a most noble thing; the Quadrangle
is a sixth part bigger than that of Christchurch in
Oxford. The Library is very handsome, and esteemed
one of the finest rooms in the World. In the Library
there is preserved the skeleton of a gentleman who left
his bones as a monument of his regard to mankind on
purpose to instruct even the most superficial observer
of the formation of the human body, and at the same
time designed that his name, like his body, might be
snatched from the grave; how various are the roads to
Fame! Some seek them by grand and pompous obsequies;
others expect them for not having Christian burial,
and hope to be remembered by a magnificent tomb, or
the want of a coffin. I always thought vanity the very
marrow of a human creature, and it sticks to them even
to their very bones.... What gives me the greatest
pleasure is the seeing Dr. Middleton married to a
person<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 460">[460]</a> who seems formed to make him happy; she is
very well bred and agreeable, has a most obliging temper,
likes his manner of life, shows him the greatest regard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
and among her accomplishments I must take notice of
her playing on the Harpsichord in great perfection.</p>

This sentence shows that Mrs. Donnellan was a friend of
Mr. Samuel Richardson, the great author: “I wish you

you have a good right to be of so harmonious a society.”
North End, near Fulham, was Mr. Richardson’s<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 461">[461]</a> country

<div class="sidenote">PEACE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes to her sister, who was still at
Bath on June 25, from Hill Street, where, as she states,
everything is in great confusion, “the middle floors not
laid.” Mrs. Dettemere, her lady’s-maid, had just lost her
husband, whom she had not seen for years, but loved
dearly. She appears to have been a poor lady, but the
cause of her living separate from her husband does not
appear. Dr. Shaw had been consulted as to a return
of Mrs. Montagu’s spasms of the stomach, and recommended
the extraordinary remedy of “sweating.” This
was to remain in bed for days and weeks in flannel
sheets, which at midsummer could have hardly been
endured. She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He assures me I shall neither be sick or nervous: after
my sweating fit is over, I am to drink asses’ milk, ride on
horseback, and grow fat and jolly. I am now thinner
than ever, so the reformation will be greater if I
grow fat.... My brother Robinson had a very pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
journey to Aix, where I daresay he will have a great
deal of pleasure. There will be a great concourse of
people of all nations, and Lord and Lady Sandwich are
extremely obliging to him....</p>

<p>“Mr. Flower sent your jumps<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 462">[462]</a> yesterday; I did not

March, Lord Sandwich and Sir Thomas Robinson<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 463">[463]</a> being
the English plenipotentiaries. Lady Sandwich, going out
to join her husband, persuaded Mr. Matthew Robinson,
who was a great friend, to escort her to Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p>In order to while away the weary hours of lying in
bed at Sandleford, Miss Anstey and Dettemere had to
read aloud to Mrs. Montagu <cite>Admiral Anson’s book, “A
Voyage round the World</cite>,” recently published. Sarah
Robinson designated it “as the best receipt book in
England as far as dressing turtles and some Indian
animals can reach.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan had lost her stepfather, Mr. Percival,
on April 26 of this year. He had long been in declining
health. She was very anxious about the remedy Mrs.
Montagu was taking, and demanded constant news. She
recommends <cite>Townsend’s “Translation of the Conquest
of Mexico”</cite> to be read to Mrs. Montagu. Her mother,
she writes, had taken a house for the summer months
“a little beyond the walls of Kensington gardens, and
I have a key to the nearest door.”</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw is mentioned as going away on his travels,
leaving no directions for his patients, and the Duchess
of Portland as giving him £600 to enable him to travel
and find her shells and curiosities, for which she had
an insatiable appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>Sarah Robinson continued at Bath with Lady Bab
Montagu, and hints are thrown out in some of the letters
of an attachment springing up between her and Mr. G.
L. Scott, mentioned before. Captain Pigott, an admirer
of Sarah’s, is described as “dressed according to custom
in a tied wig fresh powdered, a bloom colour cloth coat,
laced most magnificently with gold, and bloom-coloured
stockings; he visits our door continually, but all the
consequence is a little expense in chair hire to him.”</p>

<p>Three letters of Matthew Robinson to his sister from
the Continent whilst with Lord and Lady Sandwich
contain a few interesting paragraphs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After my last letter we set out for Spa, whither
we travelled through the Dutchy of Limburg, a most
beautiful country to look at, and among the rest we
saw to the left the Forest of Arden where Jacques
moralized, but though it is about 80 miles in circumference,
by means of bad government and its revenues
being carried to its Princess, the Empress, to Vienna
its capital, Limburg is a pitiful village and in the whole
Dutchy there are not above 4 or 5 other villages, still
more contemptible. At Spa we lived a very merry life,
and were entertained by an Hungarian Prince and other
German nobility. Tokay and other very good wines
gave us a taste how very fine a country Hungary must
be, but our scheme was unluckily cut short in the
middle by Lord Sandwich having a sudden call to Aix.
Upon our return Sir Thomas Robinson was here, who
at his Lordship’s request is joined with him as second
plenipotentiary; he says he is an old familiar of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Father’s, and inquires much after him. Our life here is
as it used to be. The Sunday before last there was a
most magnificent gala, a dinner, supper and ball at the
French ambassador’s on account of St. Louis’ day, where
I assure you I was much charm’d with the unaffected
liveliness and gaiety of the French.... Last Sunday
we had a second part of the same comedy by the Dutch
on account of the Prince of Orange’s birthday; besides
a dinner and supper, there was a ball at the Maison de
Ville, which of itself is very magnificent, and was finely
decorated by Mr. Vanharen. Lady Sandwich both in
her journey and here has often wished for your company....
To-morrow morning I set out for Bonn upon
the Rhine, and we go from thence all down the Rhine to
the Hague.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE HAGUE</div>

<p>Matthew and a Mr. Gee left Lord and Lady Sandwich
at Aix. Young Edward Wortley Montagu was
acting-secretary to Lord Sandwich. From the Hague he
writes in October—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since I wrote to you last I have taken a long and
pleasant journey up the Rhine among the palaces of the
four Electors, from thence I am come to the Hague,
about 10 days ago. From the neatness of the town,
the incomparable walks and rides about it, its rendezvous
of Ministers and politicks, it is a very agreeable
place to live in. The Ministers here by turns hold
assemblies of the men at their houses, morning and
evening, and I have dined at the house of one or other
of them almost every day. The court is well filled and
well attended, but as formal as our own.... The most
extraordinary person here is Mr. Grounen, the Father
of Mrs. Trevor, wife of our envoy, who has knowledge
and sense enough to be mighty well acquainted with the
History of Europe, and to be supposed by some people
to be writing the History of his own times, to have constantly
every noon about him a resort of the Ministers
and best company here, to be the center of all their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
news, and to be the particular and intimate acquaintance
of several great men, and among the rest the correspondent
of Lord Chesterfield, and yet at the same time to
be so mad as for fear of infection literally not to touch
any human creature, neither his servants, his children,
nor even his second wife!”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MR. JAMES MONTAGU</div>

<p>Mr. James Montagu, half-brother to Mr. Edward
Montagu, had for some time been deaf, and was now
in a very dropsical state; he now fell very ill. Mr. and
Mrs. Montagu nursed him tenderly till the end, which
took place on October 30. From letters of Mrs. Medows
to Mrs. Montagu one learns the brothers had not been
brought up together; hence the blow was less acutely
felt. He appears to have died in London. His estate
of Newbold Verdon in Leicestershire was left to Wortley
Montagu. Mrs. Medows says, “I can’t help feeling
a little hurt that Newbold goes where it should not,
but I really believe Sandleford is a pleasanter place to
live in.”</p>

<p>In a letter to Sarah, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Montagu is now returned from the melancholy
ceremony of opening the will. My brother has left us
a handsome legacy, and also all his plate and jewels,
which last, he told the person who made the codicil,
would be proper for me, as I had refused any when I
married, perhaps his brother would forget them. I
hear the plate is valued at £1500, and the jewels, they
say, are fine, but I never saw them. I esteem the good
will and kindness of the donor more than ever I shall
the glittering gems.”</p>
</div>

<p>The two sailor brothers had just returned from the
East Indies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Charles grown from a fine boy to a very clever
man, he is improved in all respects.... My house
looks like an Indian warehouse: I have got so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
figures, jars, etc., etc., you would laugh at the collection,
my gown I brought out of the ship buckled under my
jumps, it is very pretty and the work extremely neat.
The Captain has brought China, Lutestrings, taffeties
and Paduasoys, they wear so well, but the colors are
not as good as those of our manufacture.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PRICE OF TEA</div>

<p>Tea was also brought, and Dr. Conyers Middleton
had 4 lbs. at 16<i>s.</i> a pound. He had just brought out his
“<cite>Free Enquiry into the Miraculous Powers</cite>.” Matthew
Robinson writes of it on December 17, “Middleton
will tell you there is no belief to be given to any of the
miracles related by the Fathers, Hume<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 466">[466]</a> says that there
is no belief to be given to miracles related by any man
whatsoever.” And thus end the letters of 1748.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu paid a visit to the Bothams at Albury
soon after this. From the letters it appears Mr. Matthew
Robinson was pressing a suit on Miss Godschall, a rich

<p>In June, Mrs. Montagu, being recommended to drink
the Tunbridge waters, was accompanied by Lady

age of fifteen! An amiable, affectionate person, and a

for her chariot to be sent to her; she and Lady Sandwich
having performed the journey in Lady Sandwich’s

during which Lady Talbot had a bad fall from her
horse. A report reaching Tunbridge Wells that Lord
Sandwich had a fever, his wife, accompanied by Mrs.
Montagu, drove in four hours to London, where they
found him recovered by the taking of bark. As Lady
Sandwich wished to be present at the Huntingdon races,
she did not return to Tunbridge, but Mrs. Montagu
persuaded her sister-in-law, Mrs. Medows, to accompany
her there for a week. Mr. Montagu now joined her
from Sandleford, whither he had been accompanied by
Captain Robert Robinson, the sailor brother. The
captain proceeded on to Bath to see Sarah. Before
leaving town, Mr. Montagu had been much distressed
at the illness of his relative, the Duke of Montagu, and
sent daily to inquire after him. He had only been at
Tunbridge a few days before the duke died, and he was
summoned to town as an executor, together with the

were left to his servants, dogs, and cats. Horace says,

<p>Mr. Montagu got £100 as executor. Whilst he was
detained in London, Mrs. Montagu made an expedition
to Coombe Bank in company of Mr. and Mrs. Vesey.
This is the first mention of people who were destined
to become most intimate friends. Mrs. Vesey was the
daughter of Sir Thomas Vesey, Bishop of Ossory. She
married, first, Mr. William Handcock; secondly, her

was M.P. for Harris Town.</p>

<p>“I went yesterday along with Mrs. Vesey to see
General Campbell’s place; we set out to avoid heat a

We got to Coombe Banke by nine. It is about 16 miles<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 478">[478]</a>
from here. We walked about the gardens, which are
very pretty, and saw the house, dined under the shade,
and about 4 o’clock Mr. and Mrs. Vesey got into their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>

went to Senoak, where Lady Allen’s coach waited for
me. Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson were just come
to the inn, and going to dine on turtle, to which they
invited me, but I had made a more agreeable meal in
General Campbell’s garden.... I am going to dinner
to Lady Talbot’s, where I breakfasted. Lord Sandwich
and Lord and Lady Anson and a great deal of company
are to dine there. We have now such a crowd we
expect a splendid ball to-night. I received great civility
from Mr. and Mrs. Vesey, and they desired to know how
I got home last night, so I must beg you to send the
enclosed note to them in Bolton Row. They desired
leave to see the house and celebrated feather screen, so
I have wrote to Betty to have the house in order, and
to set the screen for them.... Coombank is but a small
place, but a fine terrace commands a beautiful view of
the country. The house is most elegantly furnished.
We were offered everything as politely as if the General
had been there. We had a fine dessert of fruit served
in the finest china. Our dinner we carried, but wine,
tea and coffee were offered us.”</p>

<p>This feather screen was in six panels, one of which
was worked by Miss Anstey, in imitation of one of the
Duchess of Portland’s. The feather work, immortalized
afterwards by the poet Cowper, had been begun, but it
was the Duchess of Portland’s original idea. Numerous
letters mention feathers being sent or asked for. Lydia
Botham collected the plumage of peacocks, pheasants,
and jays. Every known sort of parrot and macaw was
placed under contribution. From Albury the boxes of
feathers were sent by the Guildford coach to the “White
Horse cellar in Piccadilly.” With these came fifty pens
made by Lydia from her geese.</p>

the Terrass well knew. The venerable old elms in the
road are very ornamental, and the wood at the bottom
of the garden is pretty as is also the plantation in the
Park. The brook from whence the place takes its name
is at a due distance from the house, and might be
improved into a river or fine piece of water. I doubt

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lady Sandwich was so good as to spend a week
with us, and as the weather was fine for this time of
year, we went out in the post-chaise all the morning,
then dinner, tea and supper pretty well filled the rest of
the time. On Monday I went with her Ladyship to
Reading, where we lay that night. The next morning
she went to town, and I returned hither, where I found
my brothers, who give me a very agreeable account of
your health ... I saw our friend Cotes the day before
I left town, she is very well and in good spirits, and
seems determined to keep her freedom and enter no
more into wedlock’s bonds. She has only a small
lodging, and I think with her economy she might afford
herself a house of her own, and she might furnish it in
the present fashion, of some cheap paper and ornaments
of Chelsea China or the manufacture of Bow, which
makes a room look neat and finished. They are not so
sumptuous as mighty Pagodas of China or nodding
Mandarins. My dressing room in London is like the
Temple of some Indian god: if I was remarkably short
and had a great head, I should be afraid people would
think I meant myself Divine Honours, but I can so little
pretend to the embonpoint of a Josse, it is impossible to
suspect me of such presumption. The very curtains
are Chinese pictures on gauze, and the chairs the Indian
fan sticks with cushions of Japan satin painted: as
to the beauty of colouring, it is carried as high as
possible, but the toilette you were so good as to paint is
the only thing where nature triumphs. Lady Sandwich
brought her sons here, they are charming boys; Lord
Hinchinbrooke<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 483">[483]</a> is much improved since you saw him,

of application will make her useful to herself and other
people. I was afraid she would never have been either
of those things! Her Father and Mother are much afraid
she should be buried in Westminster Abbey near the
lady that dyed by the pinch of her finger in working,
but I will lay some wager on her head she will not be

<div class="sidenote">LORD PEMBROKE’S DEATH</div>

<p>A letter occurs now from the Duchess Dowager of
Chandos, third wife, and widow since 1744, of the 1st
Duke of Chandos, surnamed the “Princely Duke,” the
builder of the palatial residence of Canons, in Middlesex,
on which he spent £200,000. Having spent his fortune
in building and speculating, Canons was sold for the
<em>material</em> at his death. The duchess’s maiden name was
Van Hatten, but she had been married to a Sir Thomas
Davall. After the duke’s death she came to reside at
Shaw House,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 487">[487]</a> near Newbury, from whence she writes
to Mrs. Montagu, and after some inquiries as to health,
etc., says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What different tempers the world consists of: I am
told passion sent the late Lord Pembroke<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 488">[488]</a> out of the
world, but that Mr. Middleton who opened him says
that both heart and all the vitals were displaced by
the continual swathing he used to keep himself from
growing bulky. This was itself a discontented temper,
and if at any time I should be extremely strait laced
and contradicted, it is certain my crossness would have
been very great, and I or my lace must burst. The
giving Ward’s pill to a cock and then turning it into broth
for old Lady Northampton<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 489">[489]</a> has something curious in it
too, but as it ended in death, I suppose will not be
practised further. How many tricks do we try to
lengthen life, and yet like poor Lord Pembroke waste it
in tormenting our blood because others will not be of our
mind, or we are too fat, or too lean to please ourselves:
if there is not another life where we may be more perfect,

<div class="sidenote">THE EARTHQUAKE</div>

<p>The earthquake mentioned by Horace Walpole in
his letters to Sir Horace Mann, page 349 in volume 2,
on February 5, created much terror. The Montagus
were in Hill Street at the time. On February 20, in a
letter to her sister, Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was not under any apprehensions about the earthquake,
but went that night to the Oratorio, then quietly
to bed, but the madness of the multitude was prodigious,
near 50 of the people I had sent to, to play at cards here
the Saturday following, went out of town to avoid being
swallowed, and I believe they made a third part of the
number I asked, so that you may imagine how universal
the fright must be. The Wednesday night the Oratorio
was very empty, though it was the most favourite performance
of Handel’s.”</p>
</div>

<p>A slighter shock took place a month later; some
people prognosticated a worse shock on April 3, which
was to swallow up London. The following letter of the
Duchess of Chandos alludes to this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Shaw, April 3.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I do assure you although I had many accounts
of the earthquake, I do easily perceive the difference
betwixt a fright, and a sensible account of the same
matter of fact: the day this, I hope, will kiss your hands
and find perfect peace and safety at Hill Street, is the
day when in many people have great fears, but in my
opinion without reason, for I never heard of periodical
earthquakes, and the coolness of the weather I hope will
assuage these sulphurous heats. It would now bear
hard upon Human understanding as well as gratitude,
if when they see how very easily the destruction of
popular places may be effected, we should not all live in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
such a way as to make Death not so extremely shocking
to us, as it has appeared to some of the gay world at
this time. The same Providence that certainly made
this complicated and beautiful Machine, is not the
children that blow bubbles in air only to divert themselves,
but has will, and good further designs suitable to
His infinite goodness and wisdom, and therefore a hope
in Him is a real security in all evils, and as to the manner
of Death I have it, may be a peculiar thought, that there
is a degree of pain that human nature cannot exceed
consistent with life; which is a great mercy, or else our
cruelty to one another would be without bounds: therefore
I will never be too anxious what is the manner of
my death, but trust it to that power that sent me into
life....</p>

Edward Boscawen, second son of 1st Viscount Falmouth,
in 1742. As Dorothy Boscawen, aunt to the Admiral,
married Sir Philip Medows, the families were already
connected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Medows writes to Mrs. Montagu, “I think of
Mrs. Boscawen as you do, I expect you should be fond
of the Admiral,<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 493">[493]</a> his cool courage, his firmness, good

Mr. Montagu would have to be in London. The reception

near Croydon, Mrs. Montagu went to see it, and made
her first acquaintance with Mr. Gilbert West.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 495">[495]</a> He was
the son of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Richard West by Maria, daughter

his mother had remarried Lord John Langham. West
was a cousin of Mr. Botham’s, also of Mr. Lyttelton,
afterwards Sir George Lyttelton. Writing to Mrs. Boscawen,
Mrs. Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I saw at Wickham the miracle of the Moral World,
a Christian Poet, an humble philosopher, a great genius,

<div class="sidenote">THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF CHANDOS</div>

<p>Probably the Duchess of Portland may have been
one, as she sided with Sarah in the affair, telling Mrs.
Montagu that she might wish to obey her in all other
respects, but could not control her affections. Lord
Bolingbroke is said to have recommended him through
Lord Bathurst. The ill-starred marriage took place
probably at the commencement of 1751, but no letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
are left recording it. On November 18 the Dowager
Duchess of Chandos died at Shaw House, near Newbury,
and in a letter to Miss Anstey is thus noticed—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A little before I went to London I lost my very
good neighbour, the Duchess of Chandos, a stroke of
the palsy carried her off in a few days: her bodily pains
were great, but her mind felt the serenity that gilds the
evening of a virtuous life. She quitted the world with
that decent fare-well which people take of it, who rather
consider it as a place in which they are to impart good
than to enjoy it. Her character has made a great impression
on me, as I think her a rare instance that age
could not make conceited and stiff, nor retirement discontented,
nor virtue inflexible and severe.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Mrs. Donnellan, on December 30, Mrs. Montagu
says, “The Duchess of Chandos is greatly missed by
the poor this rigorous season.”</p>

<p>In these two letters the following books and
pamphlets are recommended, “<cite>An Occasional Letter</cite>,”
said to be Lord Bolingbroke’s;<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 505">[505]</a> the King of Prussia’s

<p>January, 1751, finds Mrs. Montagu in London, and
Mr. Montagu at Sandleford Priory, engaged in business
affairs. Mrs. Montagu, on January 7, writes to him—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I am glad you are so far tired of your monastic
life as to think of returning to the secular state of a
husband and a member of Parliament. I believe our

<i>volupté</i> which silence, secresy and peace might much
enhance and recommend; but to those who have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
used to the bustle and business of life such pleasures
want vivacity. Boileau makes a man who goes to visit
the Chantre just before dinner observe the luxury of a
prebendal table. Says he—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I have sat so constantly in Lady Sandwich’s chimney
corner, I can give you little account of the world.”</p>
</div>

<p>To which Mr. Montagu rejoins, “I am much obliged
to you for the kind impatience you show at my stay
here; in a few days I now hope to convince you that
however unworthy of either state, I have deserted
neither.” He was accompanied to London by Captain
Robinson.</p>

<p>From a letter of Mr. Gilbert West’s of May 16, 1751,
we learn that Mrs. Montagu, though wishing to be
near London and yet not in it, did not take up her
temporary residence at Hayes till then. In it he says,
“I have agreed with a farmer at Wickham to fetch your
goods at the price of 15 shillings: the waggon will be
in Hill Street to-morrow morning early.” He desires
her to breakfast and dine at West Wickham with him,
and signs himself, “Dear Madam, your loving cousin to
command till death, G. W.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE COUSINHOOD”</div>

<p>In the collection of letters published by her nephew,
Matthew Robinson, 4th Baron Rokeby, he says he
cannot remember the reason why West and Mrs. Montagu
called each other cousins, but he had forgotten his
cousinship to the Bothams, the beloved cousins of his
aunt, Mrs. Montagu. “The cousinhood” was also the
favourite term of the whole set of Wests, Pitts, and
Lytteltons, all much connected in marriage and extreme
intimacy.</p>

<p>Gilbert West was at this period forty-five years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
age only, but even then a perfect martyr to gout.
Amongst his poems and translations was <cite>Lucian’s
“Triumph of the Gout,”</cite> every line of which he could
painfully indorse. In his <cite>“Lives of the Poets” Dr.
Johnson</cite><a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 506">[506]</a> brackets him with Crashaw under “the two
venerable names of <em>Poet and Saint</em>.” He was often
visited by Lyttelton and Pitt, “who, when they were
weary of faction and debates, used at Wickham to
find books and quiet, a decent table and literary conversation.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_506" href="#FNanchor_506" title="Return to text.">[506]</a> <i>Vide</i> <cite>Johnson’s “Lives of the Poets.”</cite></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There may still be seen at Wickham a walk made
by Pitt, and at Wickham, Lyttelton received that
conviction which produced his “Dissertation on Saint
Paul.” The same spirit of <em>cheerful</em> and <em>benign religion</em>
was now to exercise a large influence on Elizabeth
Montagu, to strengthen her already religious turn of
mind, and to enable her in the future, though living in
the great world of fashion and rank, and the idol of
society, to keep that sacred, secret lamp of spirituality
<em>not of this world</em> alight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEST FAMILY</div>

<p>The family circle at the Wests was a happy one; his
wife and sister adored him, and he was the magnet that
attracted all to him. He had a great sense of humour
and a pretty taste for decorating, as the many letters
upon the subject of the adornment of the Hill Street
rooms show; Mrs. Montagu took his advice in every
point from this time till his death in 1756. At the period
I am now writing of he was far from well off, though
expecting promotion, with just reason, having been a
faithful servant to the King, and secretary to Lord Townshend
during his period of office as Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. R. BERANGER</div>

<p>Amongst the friends of the Wests, Mrs. Montagu
now made acquaintance with Mr. R. Berenger,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 507">[507]</a> called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
by Mrs. West “the little Marquis.” He was the son of
Moses Beranger and Penelope Temple, and was therefore
related on the maternal side to West. He afterwards
became “Gentleman of the Horse” to George <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
He wrote a book called the “<cite>History and Art of Horsemanship</cite>.”
He was famous for his charm in social life.
Hannah More called him “everybody’s favourite, all
chivalry, blank verse and anecdote,” and Dr. Johnson
dubbed him “the Standard of true Elegance.” He was
a great friend of the Garricks. Another fresh acquaintance
was William Henry Lyttelton, brother of Sir
George (afterwards Lord) Westcote.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At some early period of this year Sarah Robinson
became the wife of George Lewis Scott, but no date
is recorded, and no letters concerning the marriage
remain. Only on June 9, when Mrs. Montagu was
making her yearly visit to Tunbridge Wells in company
with Lady Romney, she writes to her husband at
Sandleford to say she had arrived safely, “Mrs. Scott
and the Captain,” whose departure to China had been
delayed, seeing her off. From other letters it appears
the Scotts, accompanied by Lady Barbara Montagu,
took up their abode in Leicester Fields, now Leicester
Square, doubtless to be close to Leicester House, where,
with their mother, the widowed Princess of Wales,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 508">[508]</a>
Scott’s royal pupils dwelt.</p>

<p>At Tunbridge Mrs. Montagu joined Mr. and Mrs.
West and their son, and lodged in the same house. At
Tunbridge were Sir George Lyttelton, his brother the
Dean, the famous Mr. Garrick, the Bishop of London, etc.
Then she wrote—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Monsieur<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 509">[509]</a> and Madame Mirepoix are come to pass
a few days here, but I imagine they will soon be tired
of us. The Justices of Peace have done great service
to the imprudent part of our company by prohibiting
gaming, and though you may suppose I do not number
myself among them, I feel my obligations to them on
account of the servants, who have one temptation less
to be idle and bad.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>She then adds grateful words to her husband, who
had written to say he had made a fresh will, and in her
favour. Mr. Montagu was then in London, but on the eve
of going north to attend to his own estates in Yorkshire,
and the complicated business of regulating Mr. Rogers’
affairs in Northumberland. In this letter he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I this day, though I could ill spare the time, dined in
Leicester Fields” (with the Scotts). “Being in the city
I was informed by Dr. Middleton’s bookseller that Mrs.
Middleton has had the good luck to sell Hildersham for
2000 guineas, it cost the Doctor, he said, £1600, besides
what he lay’d out in building, so that if there should be
some loss it cannot be much.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">HILDERSHAM</div>

<p>Hildersham was some miles from Cambridge. Here
Gray, the poet, loved to visit Conyers Middleton, and
improved his friendship with William Robinson, who
was preparing for Holy Orders, and whom Gray always
called the “Reverend Billy.”</p>

<p>On July 23 Mr. Montagu writes from Huntingdon—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I lay last night at Cambridge. I dined with Mrs.
Middleton in company with your brother, and the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I can tell you little about the races, having no concern

he won.</p>

<p>“At the ball all the family of the Naylors were

country dances. Miss Maria Naylor danced both kind

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu writes to say her father had arrived
at Tunbridge in great spirits with a party of five, and
she was, she adds, much better.</p>

Maria Naylor had an opportunity of shining in her proper

Gunnings<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 518">[518]</a> of universal empire drive her from her little
native land? Do they want to add the epithet of great to
their names? Indeed I do not know why Gunning the
great should not sound as well as Alexander the Great.
I am afraid the eldest Miss Naylor is much dejected at
the infidelity of our cousin Wortley, who is greatly
enamoured of little Miss Ashe. All collectors of natural
curiosities love something of every species. Mr. Wortley
has had a passion for all sorts and sizes of women. Miss
Ashe is a sort of middle species between a woman and a
fairy, and by her rarity worthy to be added even to so
large a collection of amours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MISS ASHE</div>

<p>Miss Ashe, or the “Pollard Ashe,” as Walpole called
her, eloped with Edward Wortley Montagu in the
autumn of 1751. He was soon after this put in prison
with a Mr. Taafe in France for robbing or cheating a
Jew. As he was married before, though separated from
his wife, he could not marry Miss Ashe. She afterwards
married a Mr. Falconer, R.N.</p>

<p>It was in this year Horace Walpole had written to
Sir Horace Mann—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our greatest miracle is Lady Mary Wortley’s son
whose adventures have made so much noise, his parts
are not proportionate, but his expense is incredible.
His father scarce allows him anything, yet he plays,
dresses, diamonds himself, even to distinct shoe buckles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
for a frock, and has more snuff-boxes than would suffice
a Chinese idol with an hundred noses. But the most
curious part of his dress, which he has brought from
Paris, is an iron wig; you literally would not know it
from hair. I believe it is on this account that the Royal
Society have just chosen him of their body.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Montagu wrote the description of “our cousin’s
adventures,” and after several comments on Wortley’s
conduct, she says, “Poor Miss Ashe weeps like the
forsaken Ariadne on a foreign shore.”</p>

<p>The company at Tunbridge Wells had been increased
by the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, the Duchess of
Norfolk, and, Mrs. Montagu writes, “we expect those
goddesses called the Gunnings and Sir Thomas
Robinson.... My Father is very gay, but complains
he never saw the place so dull. I never said so to
those about me, lest they should say to me as Swift
to the fat man who complained of a crowd, ‘Friend, you
make the very crowd you blame!’ Mr. West reads to
us in the evening, and the wit of the last age supplies
us when we do not meet with any in this.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF MRS. PERCIVAL —<br>
DR. SHAW</div>

<p>At this period Mrs. Percival (Anne Donnellan’s
mother) died; she had long been in bad health. Dr.
Shaw, the celebrated traveller, died also, and Mrs.
Montagu comments thus on August 29 on the two events
to her husband, who was then at Newcastle—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to poor Mrs. Percival I hailed her voyage to
the realms of rest: the last page of life is commonly a
blank. But for poor Shaw,<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 519">[519]</a> he might have lived and
laughed and talked of the Deluge and collected cockle
shells many years longer. The death of those we
esteem afflicts us; we are shocked at the death of those
we have laughed<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 520">[520]</a> at and laughed with, as we never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
looked upon them in so serious a light as to suppose so
sad an event could happen to them. I would deck his
tomb with emblems of all the wonders of the land and
deep; crocodiles should weep and tigers howl; every
shell should become vocal; sea-weed should bloom immortal
on his tomb, and moss, though petrified, lie
lightly on his breast. What signify voyages? What
signifies learning! Hebrew Professor! Traveller to
Memphis! Sole witness living of the present state of
the Ptolemies! Must all these glories sink into oblivion?
How gloriously had he been interred had he died in the
perilous pass of the Pyramids, and succeeded Mark
Anthony in the bed of Cleopatra! I hope the poor man
will have the satisfaction of being embalmed in the true
Egyptian manner, for the more like a mummy his body
be made, the more it will joy his gentle ghost. Nature
has lost the inventory of all works in losing Shaw, for
he knew every plant from the Hyssop to the Cedar of
Lebanon, and every animal from the pismire to the
whale. I am afraid his sister Sarah must again dust
down those cobwebs she has been taught to venerate,
and kill the moths in a stuff turban, though it should
have a horn more or a horn less.”</p>

<p>In a letter from Newcastle of September 1, Mr.
Montagu, who with his steward, Mr. Carter, was regulating
the business of his cousin, Mr. Rogers, mentions
Denton Hall<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 521">[521]</a> for the first time, which was eventually to
become one of his residences.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_521" href="#FNanchor_521" title="Return to text.">[521]</a> Note at the end of this work on Denton Hall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yesterday Mr. Carter and I rid to Denton, which
is about 3 miles from Newcastle. We first viewed the
house which is a good deal worse than I thought, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
indeed so bad that it would not be justifiable to lay out
any money upon it. The rooms on the second floor are
pretty good, and served the family when they went
there, but if ever I should be so happy as to have your
company in these parts, if these should be thought fit I
would hope it would be no difficult matter to find you
some better accommodation. This next week I propose
to go to a Farm of Mr. R.’s at Jarrow, about ten miles
from Newcastle, and to Monk Seaton, where he has
another. I never have yet been at either of them.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">JARROW</div>

<p>Amongst his other property Mr. Rogers owned
much in coal mines, some of them entirely his own,
others in which, with the Claverings, Mr. Bowes, the
Bishop of Durham, etc., he owned a share. Mr. Montagu
was employing a Mr. Newton to value these—a
complicated, unfair business. Owing to Mr. Rogers’
lunacy, much advantage had been taken by dishonest
stewards and coal merchants, too long and complicated
for description in these pages. On September 8 Mr.
Montagu writes—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Friday last I was at a farm one half whereof
belongs to Mr. Rogers, the other to Sir Thomas Clavering,
called Jarrow, not far from Tynemouth, it is in the
parish where the Venerable Bede formerly practised.
Upon a Key this estate is obliged to contribute to for
the repair of all the Ships that come to this port, they
unload their ballast, which in length of time is become an
incredible heap. This estate is let at £107 10<i>s.</i> per <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr>
To-morrow we go to Ravensworth, after which, when
we shall have visited Seaton and Rudchester, we shall
have seen all Mr. R.’s territories.”</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CARLISLE TURNPIKE ROAD</div>

<p>In the next letter he says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“North Seaton lies upon the sea, consists of very
good land with coal under, and has a key and a granary
for corn and some quarrys of stone. The other estate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
of Rudchester is that through which the Carlisle Road
is to pass, and which with all the clamour of the tenants
will, as we think, be rather a benefit than hurt to the
estate. It is thought to have a good deal of good coal
in it, and but a very little way from the river Tyne, and
will be very valuable if ever the river should be made
navigable so high up as Mr. Carter thinks it may be in
twenty years’ time.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Montagu also adds that he and Mr. Carter have
discovered that Mr. Rogers owned two-thirds of a
colliery at West Denton, of which they had not known.</p>

<p>On September 13 a son was born to the Dauphin<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 522">[522]</a>
of France, and Mrs. Montagu writes on the 15th—</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hear Monsieur Mirepoix intends the town fine
illuminations and masquerades on the birth of the
Dauphin. I believe every miserable peasant in France
has great joy in the birth of one who is to be his future
tyrant. Strange infatuation!... I wish the English
loved their Island as well as the French do their
‘Monarque.’”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 523">[523]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd Mrs. Montagu writes to say she is
packing up for London, and she begs her husband,
who is thinking of moving southward, not to travel
with a single servant, as “every newspaper is filled
with accounts of robbery.” She congratulates him “on
having so well considered and settled Mr. Rogers’
affairs. It appears a noble estate, and I hope to see it
in your possession who would nobly enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Matthew Robinson had been in Yorkshire, and
thence travelled to Scotland, then little visited. Mrs.
Montagu says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I suppose my brother Robinson is by this time
returning to the known world. I expect to hear he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
has travelled to the extremity of Scotland, for he is a
man of infinite curiosity, and would have knowledge at
no entrance quite shut out.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this her husband rejoins, “Whenever I come
near London I will hire a guard, and if I can give you
sufficient notice shall not be sorry to be met by
Brunton....” He says he has not heard of Brother
Robinson since he dined with him. “If he has gone to
Scotland, I have lately read in a book concerning the
Rebellion, that barbarous part of our island may in
good weather be seen with pleasure!” In return, his
wife writes from London that she is going to Hayes
“to enjoy quiet and my books till you arrive. I take
Mrs. Isted with me.” Mrs. Isted was a poor lady who
acted as housekeeper to Mrs. Montagu, and had seen
better days.</p>

<p>The Scotts had been dining with her. They were
then living at Chelsea, as London did not suit Sarah’s
delicate health. A scheme of education for the young
princes had been drawn up and submitted to the King,
who was much pleased with it. It was also rumoured
he was to take them to Hanover next year, “a step
which will not be popular.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. MIDDLETON’S WORKS</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Middleton’s works are to be printed by the
booksellers by subscription. Mrs. Middleton sold the
copies for £300: it seems to me an insolence in the
booksellers that should not be encouraged. I should
never grudge the guinea I could spare to a man of
genius, but to a set of wretches that live by other
people’s wits, I am not so willing to part with that
gold which the wise man allows to be better than anything
except wisdom. It is strange malice in Apollo
to make poor authors and rich booksellers, he should
give his upper servants the best wages.”</p>
</div>

<p>From Hayes, on September 30, she writes—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am so well in health that I scarce know myself,
and I think I am a little like the humorous Lieutenant
that would run no hazards when he was well, though
he was prodigal of life when he had a pain in his side.
I am very desirous to preserve this comfortable state of
health, and also my comely, plump and jolly condition;
my face is no longer a <i>memento mori</i>. I am like one of
the goddess Hebe’s elder sisters, ‘Not ever fair and
young, but not so wan and decayed as of late.’” She
adds, “Lady Bab and my sister design to visit my
solitude in a few days. She is much better for country
air, but they do not enjoy many rural pleasures at
Chelsea, it is too near London.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. DONNELLAN —<br>
JOURNEY TO IRELAND</div>

<p>Mrs. Donnellan, having let her house to Lord Holderness,
was preparing to go to Ireland to visit Dr. and
Mrs. Delany at Delville, and her relations. She was
staying with her friends the Southwells, at King’s
Weston, and as her letters throw light on the then
mode of travelling, I insert portions—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="from s9">“Delville, near Dublin, October 7.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Montagu</span>,</p>

<p class="para1">“I am sure will be pleased to hear I am got
safe to the end of my journeys and voyage, and am with
my good friend Mrs. Delany resting myself after a good
deal of fatigue. I left London as I told you I should, as
I informed you by a letter from King’s Weston, which
I hope you got. Mr. Leslie, the gentleman who took the
charge of conducting me to Ireland, came at the time
appointed, but we heard so bad an account of the cross
roads between Bristol and Chester that we were very
near setting out again for London, and going from thence
to Chester. However, I plucked up courage, and as
my good friends would do everything to accommodate
me, we set out on Thursday sen’night with Mr. Southwell’s
coach, two post-chaises and Mr. Southwell’s groom
and double horse,<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 524">[524]</a> so that we had variety enough. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
road for the greatest part to Gloucester was so bad I
rid most of it, but hearing it would rather mend I sent
back the coach, and between the chaise and the horse
got to Chester and on to Park Gate in five days, and
Mr. Leslie my companion, being a very sensible, polite
travelled man, made the journey as agreeable as such a
journey could be. We found Lord and Lady Fitzwilliams
and many more waiting at Park Gate for the
King’s Yacht, but as I hate a crowded ship and am not
a coward, I resolved not to wait, and the wind being
fair, we hired a small ship for ten guineas and set sail.
The next morning at six o’clock and with the finest
weather imaginable made our passage and landed in
Dublin in 30 hours. The Bishop of Clogher, who had
been enquiring for me the morning tide, came to the
house when I was landed, with his usual politeness, and
carried me to their house, and as it was too late to come
here, they kept me that night, and the next day Mrs.
Delany came and brought me here, where I am extremely
happy, the most polite and hearty welcome, a
large and convenient house, sweet gardens and a manner
of living quite to my sober taste. Our only disturbance
are visitors: we had yesterday seven coaches and six,
mostly my own relations, my brother, sister, nephews
and nieces.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DAUPHIN</div>

<p>On October 31 there is a letter dated from London
to Mr. Gilbert West. In this Mrs. Montagu is forwarding
him patterns of all kinds of dove-coloured paper from
Mr. Bromedge’s shop, and Mr. Linnell was sending a
marble chimney-piece for West’s big room at Wickham.
She says—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Poor Dr. Courayer notified to me that he was ill of
a sore throat, and could not come to visit me, though he
wanted to see me. I went to him, I was obliged to pass
through all the gay vanities of Mrs. Chenevix,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 525">[525]</a> and then
ascend a most steep and difficult staircase to get at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
the little Philosopher: this way to wisdom through the
vanities and splendid toys of the world might be prettily
allegorized by the pen of the great Bunyan; the good
man himself to an emblematizeing genius would have
afforded an ample subject; his head was <i>enfoncé</i> in a
cap of the warmest beaver, made still more respectable
by a gold orrace, ‘a wondrous hieroglyphick robe he
wore,’ in which was portrayed all the attributes of the
god Fo, with the arms and delineaments of the Cham
of Tartary.... I began to consider him as the best
piece of Chinese furniture I had ever seen, and could
hardly forbear offering him a place on my chimney-piece.
He asked much after your health.... There
has been a terrible fracas in the court of the grand
Monarque, the people, generally credulous, have strangely
taken it into their heads that the Duke of Burgundy is
not legitimate, and instead of acclamations and huzzas,
murmurs and sighs have echo’d through the streets, on
the days the feasts were made for the birth of this child;
besides this there was conveyed into the cradle some
gunpowder and a match with an epigram expressing
that they would serve to blow up the pretended Duke
of Burgundy. Upon his Majesty hearing this, the
gouvernante, sub-gouvernante, women of the bedchamber,
even to the toothless pap tasters, were all sent
to the Bastille, one of the women who said she saw a
hand reach over a screen to throw a paper into the
cradle is since dead. A little knowledge is allowed to
be a dangerous thing; had the lady been able to inform
his Majesty at once who threw the paper, she had been
safe, but it is supposed the hand that threw it, lest she
should discover more, gave her a dose that has silenced
her for ever....</p>

Montagu was extremely unwell, but anxious for the

of Marlborough to write her “<cite>Memoirs of her Life</cite>,” for
which she gave him £5000. He was a Roman Catholic,
a disciple of Fenelon’s, and brought a Catholic priest to
Pope on his death-bed. “Pray have you made a good

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
